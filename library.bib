@article{Duflo2021,
abstract = {Following the widespread adoption of free primary education, African policymakers are now considering making secondary school free, but little is known about the private and social benefits of free secondary education. We exploit randomized assignment to secondary school scholarships among 2,064 youths in Ghana, combined with 12 years of data, to establish that scholarships increase educational attainment, knowledge, skills, and preventative health behaviors, while reducing female fertility. Eleven years after receipt of the scholarship, only female winners show private labor market gains, but those come primarily in the form of better access to jobs with rents (in particular rationed jobs in the public sector). We develop a simple model to interpret the labor market results and help think through the welfare impact of free secondary education.},

Reduced-form estimates suggest that state abortion reforms had a negative impact on teen marriage, teen fertility, and teen out- of-wedlock childbearing. The teen marriage effects are largest and most precisely estimated for white women while the teen fertility and out-of-wedlock childbearing effects are largest and most precisely estimated for black women. The relatively modest fertility and marriage consequences of abortion reform for white women do not appear to have changed schooling or labor market outcomes. In contrast, black women who were exposed to abortion reforms experienced large reductions in teen fertility and teen out-of-wedlock fertility that appear to have led to increased schooling and employment rates. Instrumental variables estimates of the effects of teen and out-of- wedlock childbearing on the schooling and employment status of black women, using measures of exposure to abortion reform as instruments, are marginally significant and larger than the corresponding OLS estimates.},

abstract = {There are many studies where researchers are interested in estimating average treatment effects and are willing to rely on the unconfoundedness assumption, which requires that treatment assignment is as good as random conditional on pre-treatment variables. The unconfoundedness assumption is often more plausible if a large number of pre-treatment variables are included in the analysis, but this can worsen the finite sample properties of existing approaches to estimation. In particular, existing methods do not handle well the case where the model for the propensity score (that is, the model relating pre-treatment variables to treatment assignment) is not sparse. In this paper, we propose a new method for estimating average treatment effects in high dimensions that combines balancing weights and regression adjustments. We show that our estimator achieves the semi-parametric efficiency bound for estimating average treatment effects without requiring any modeling assumptions on the propensity score. The result relies on two key assumptions, namely overlap (that is, all units have a propensity score that is bounded away from 0 and 1), and sparsity of the model relating pre-treatment variables to outcomes.},

Gibbs sampling from this posterior is possible using an expanded hierarchy with conjugate normal priors for the regression parameters and independent exponential priors on their variances. A connection with the inverse-Gaussian distribution provides tractable full conditional distributions. The Bayesian Lasso provides interval estimates (Bayesian credible intervals) that can guide variable selection. Moreover, the structure of the hierarchical model provides both Bayesian and likelihood methods for selecting the Lasso parameter.

In this paper, we develop a non-parametric causal forest for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects that extends Breiman's widely used random forest algorithm. Given a potential outcomes framework with unconfoundedness, we show that causal forests are pointwise consistent for the true treatment effect, and have an asymptotically Gaussian and centered sampling distribution. We also discuss a practical method for constructing asymptotic confidence intervals for the true treatment effect that are centered at the causal forest estimates. Our theoretical results rely on a generic Gaussian theory for a large family of random forest algorithms that, to our knowledge, is the first set of results that allows any type of random forest, including classification and regression forests, to be used for provably valid statistical inference. In experiments, we find causal forests to be substantially more powerful than classical methods based on nearest-neighbor matching, especially as the number of covariates increases.},

abstract = {Data with a large number of variables relative to the sample size—"high-dimensional data"—are readily available and increasingly common in empirical economics. High-dimensional data arise through a combination of two phenomena. First, the data may be inherently high dimensional in that many different characteristics per observation are available. For example, the US Census collects information on hundreds of individual characteristics and scanner datasets record transaction-level data for households across a wide range of products. Second, even when the number of available variables is relatively small, researchers rarely know the exact functional form with which the small number of variables enter the model of interest. Researchers are thus faced with a large set of potential variables formed by different ways of interacting and transforming the underlying variables. This paper provides an overview of how innovations in "data mining" can be adapted and modified to provide high-quality inference about model parameters. Note that we use the term "data mining" in a modern sense which denotes a principled search for "true" predictive power that guards against false discovery and overfitting, does not erroneously equate in-sample fit to out-of-sample predictive ability, and accurately accounts for using the same data to examine many different hypotheses or models.},

Extending forest-based methods to these new statistical settings requires specifying tree-growing algorithms that are targeted to the task at hand, and the ad-hoc design of such algorithms can require considerable effort. In this paper, we develop a unified framework for the design of fast tree-growing procedures for tasks that can be characterized by heterogeneous estimating equations. The resulting gradient forest consists of trees grown by recursively applying a pre-processing step where we label each observation with gradient-based pseudo-outcomes, followed by a regression step that runs a standard CART regression split on these pseudo-outcomes. We apply our framework to two important statistical problems, non-parametric quantile regression and heterogeneous treatment effect estimation via instrumental variables, and we show that the resulting procedures considerably outperform baseline forests whose splitting rules do not take into account the statistical question at hand. Finally, we prove the consistency of gradient forests, and establish a central limit theorem. Our method will be available as an R-package, gradientForest, which draws from the ranger package for random forests.},

abstract = {Researchers have long struggled to identify causal effects in nonexperimental settings. Many recently proposed strategies assume ignorability of the treatment assignment mechanism and require fitting two models-one for the assignment mechanism and one for the response surface. This article proposes a strategy that instead focuses on very flexibly modeling just the response surface using a Bayesian nonparametric modeling procedure, Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART). BART has several advantages: it is far simpler to use than many recent competitors, requires less guesswork in model fitting, handles a large number of predictors, yields coherent uncertainty intervals, and fluidly handles continuous treatment variables and missing data for the outcome variable. BART also naturally identifies heterogeneous treatment effects. BART produces more accurate estimates of average treatment effects compared to propensity score matching, propensity-weighted estimators, and regression adjustment in the nonlinear simulation situations examined. Further, it is highly competitive in linear settings with the "correct" model, linear regression.

Parametric models, such as linear or logistic regression, are currently used to search for systematic treatment effect heterogeneity but suffer from several shortcomings; in particular, the potential for bias due to model misspecification and the large amount of discretion they introduce into the analysis of experimental data. Here, we explicate what we believe to be a better approach. Drawing on the statistical learning literature, we discuss Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), a method for analyzing treatment effect heterogeneity. BART automates the detection of nonlinear relationships and interactions, thereby reducing researchers' discretion when analyzing experimental data. These features make BART an appealing “off-the-shelf” tool for survey experimenters who want to model systematic treatment effect heterogeneity in a flexible and robust manner. In order to illustrate how BART can be used to detect and model heterogeneous treatment effects, we reanalyze a well-known survey experiment on welfare attitudes from the General Social Survey.},

abstract = {Distributional treatment effects can be crucial for understanding the welfare impact of interventions in development economics, yet they are typically ignored in meta-analysis due to a lack of suitable aggregation methodologies. I develop and implement a new suite of Bayesian hierarchical models and associated pooling metrics to estimate the distributional treatment effects of expanding access to microcredit on household outcomes, and to assess the external validity of the results. This requires imposing a series of interdependent con-straints to ensure that the estimates imply proper outcome distributions in both treatment and control groups. The results show that each study exhibits large treatment effects on the variance of household outcomes, but these effects are not generalizable due to substantial heterogeneity across sites -this contrasts to the results on the average treatment effects, which are negligible but highly generalizable. Aggregating the quantile treatment effects resolves this apparent puzzle: microcredit generally does not affect the distribution of house-hold outcomes below the 75th quantile, and above this point the thickness of the tails and the potential for cross-site heterogeneity prevents reliable extrapolation to the general case. Policymakers should not base decisions about the funding of microcredit interventions on any purported upper tail effects, as we effectively cannot predict the effect on the upper quantiles in the next site. However, pooling metrics applied to the set of quantile effects detect substantial similarities across sites overall, due to strong pooling on the majority of the distribution which is generally unaffected by microcredit.

In these “digital experiments,” different units (people, devices, products) respond differently to the treatment. This article presents a fast and scalable Bayesian nonparametric analysis of such heterogenous treatment effects and their measurement in relation to observable covariates. New results and algorithms are provided for quantifying the uncertainty associated with treatment effect measurement via both linear projections and nonlinear regression trees (CART and random forests). For linear projections, our inference strategy leads to results that are mostly in agreement with those from the frequentist literature. We find that linear regression adjustment of treatment effect averages (i.e., post-stratification) can provide some variance reduction, but that this reduction will be vanishingly small in the low-signal and large-sample setting of digital experiments. For regression trees, we provide uncertainty quantification for the machine learning algorithms that are commonly applied in tree-fitting. We argue that practitioners should look to ensembles of trees (forests) rather than individual trees in their analysis.

abstract = {Empirical policy research often focuses on causal inference. Since policy choices seem to depend on understanding the counterfactual— what happens with and without a policy—this tight link of causality and policy seems natural. While this link holds in many cases, we argue that there are also many policy applications where causal inference is not central, or even necessary. Consider two toy examples. One policymaker facing a drought must decide whether to invest in a rain dance to increase the chance of rain. Another seeing clouds must decide whether to take an umbrella to work to avoid getting wet on the way home. Both decisions could benefit from an empirical study of rain. But each has differ-ent requirements of the estimator. One requires causality: Do rain dances cause rain? The other does not, needing only prediction: Is the chance of rain high enough to merit an umbrella? We often focus on rain dance–like policy problems. But there are also many umbrella-like policy problems. Not only are these prediction prob-lems neglected, machine learning can help us solve them more effectively. In this paper, we (i) provide a simple frame-work that clarifies the distinction between causation and prediction; (ii) explain how machine learning adds value over traditional regression approaches in solving prediction problems; (iii) provide an empirical example from health policy to illustrate how improved predictions can generate large social impact; (iv) illustrate how " umbrella " problems are common and important in many important pol-icy domains; and (v) argue that solving these problems produces not just policy impact but also theoretical and economic insights. 1 I. Prediction and Causation Let Y be an outcome variable (such as rain) which depends in an unknown way on a set of variables X 0 and X . A policymaker must decide on X 0 (e.g., an umbrella or rain dance) in order to maximize a (known) payoff function $\pi$(X 0 , Y) . Our decision of X 0 depends on the derivative d$\pi$(X 0 , Y)},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The conditions under which bootstrap standard error estimates are theoretically justified have not received much attention, however. This article establishes conditions for the consistency of the moving blocks bootstrap estimators of the variance of the least squares estimator in linear dynamic models with dependent data. We discuss several applications of this result, in particular, the use of bootstrap standard error estimates for bootstrapping Studentized statistics. A simulation study shows that inference based on bootstrap standard error estimates may be considerably more accurate in small samples than inference based on closed-form asymptotic estimates},

The data collection and analysis are based directly on a conceptual model in which a student's final major is best viewed as the end result of a learning process. We find that students enter school quite optimistic/interested about obtaining a science degree, but that relatively few students end up graduating with a science degree. The substantial overoptimism about completing a degree in science can be attributed largely to students beginning school with misperceptions about their ability to perform well academically in science.},

@article{He,
abstract = {This paper shows that masked autoencoders (MAE) are scalable self-supervised learners for computer vision. Our MAE approach is simple: we mask random patches of the input image and reconstruct the missing pixels. It is based on two core designs. First, we develop an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture, with an encoder that operates only on the visible subset of patches (without mask tokens), along with a lightweight decoder that reconstructs the original image from the latent representation and mask tokens. Second, we find that masking a high proportion of the input image, e.g., 75%, yields a nontrivial and meaningful self-supervisory task. Coupling these two designs enables us to train large models efficiently and effectively: we accelerate training (by 3x or more) and improve accuracy. Our scalable approach allows for learning high-capacity models that generalize well: e.g., a vanilla ViT-Huge model achieves the best accuracy (87.8%) among methods that use only ImageNet-1K data. Transfer performance in downstream tasks outperforms supervised pre-training and shows promising scaling behavior.},

@article{Cohen2010,
abstract = {It is often argued that cost-sharing-charging a subsidized, positive price-for a health product is necessary to avoid wasting resources on those who will not use or do not need the product. We explore this argument through a field experiment in Kenya, in which we randomized the price at which prenatal clinics could sell long-lasting antimalarial insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) to pregnant women. We find no evidence that cost-sharing reduces wastage on those who will not use the product: women who received free ITNs are not less likely to use them than those who paid subsidized positive prices. We also find no evidence that cost-sharing induces selection of women who need the net more: those who pay higher prices appear no sicker than the average prenatal client in the area in terms of measured anemia (an important indicator of malaria). Cost-sharing does, however , considerably dampen demand. We find that uptake drops by sixty percentage points when the price of ITNs increases from zero to $0.60 (i.e., from 100% to 90% subsidy), a price still $0.15 below the price at which ITNs are currently sold to pregnant women in Kenya. We combine our estimates in a cost-effectiveness analysis of the impact of ITN prices on child mortality that incorporates both private and social returns to ITN usage. Overall, our results suggest that free distribution of ITNs could save many more lives than cost-sharing programs have achieved so far, and, given the large positive externality associated with widespread usage of ITNs, would likely do so at a lesser cost per life saved.},

We conduct a controlled randomized experiment in 100 villages of Maharashtra. Treated farmers associate RML information with a number of decisions they have made, and we find some evidence that treatment affected spatial arbitrage and crop grading. But the magnitude of these effects is small. We find no statistically significant average effect of treatment on the price received by farmers, crop value-added, crop losses resulting from rainstorms, or the likelihood of changing crop varieties and cultivation practices. Although disappointing, these results are in line with the market take-up rate of the RML service in the study districts, which shows small numbers of clients in aggregate and a relative stagnation in take-up over the study period.},

Using a weak-predictor local asymptotic scheme, we provide a representation result that facilitates comparison of the distributional properties of the procedures and their associated forecast risks. This representation isolates the source of inefficiency in some of these procedures.We develop a simulation procedure that improves the accuracy of the out-of-sample and split-sample methods uniformly over the local parameter space. We also examine how bootstrap aggregation (bagging) affects the local asymptotic risk of the estimators and their associated forecasts. Numerically, we find that for many val- ues of the local parameter, the out-of-sample and split-sample schemes perform poorly if implemented in the conventional way. But they perform well, if implemented in con- junction with our risk-reduction method or bagging},

abstract = {We present new evidence on the randomization methods used in existing experiments, and new simulations comparing these ­methods. We find that many papers do not describe the randomization in detail, implying that better reporting is needed. Our simulations suggest that in samples of 300 or more, the different methods perform similarly. However, for very persistent outcome variables, and in smaller samples, pair-wise matching and stratification perform best and appear to dominate the rerandomization methods commonly used in practice. The simulations also point to specific recommendations for which variables to balance on, and for which controls to include in the ex post analysis. (JEL C83, C93, O12)},

I extend previous work started by Manski (2004) that applied the minimax regret criterion to treatment choice problems by considering decision criteria that asymmetrically treat Type I regret (due to mistakenly choosing an inferior new treatment) and Type II regret (due to mistakenly rejecting a superior innovation) and derive exact finite sample solutions to these problems for experiments with normal, Bernoulli and bounded distributions of outcomes. The paper also evaluates the properties of treatment choice and sample size selection based on classical hypothesis tests and power calculations in terms of regret. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Simulation results for a stylized urban area show that this welfare cost is approximately 2% of household income.

The intervention, Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS), is currently part of national sanitation policy in more than 25 countries. While average impacts are exiguous almost three years after implementation at scale, the results hide important heterogeneity: the intervention has strong and lasting effects on sanitation practices in poorer communities. These are realized through increased sanitation investments. We show that community wealth, widely available in secondary data, is a key statistic for effective intervention targeting. Using data from five other similar randomized interventions in various contexts, we find that community-level wealth heterogeneity can rationalize the wide range of impact estimates in the literature. This exercise provides plausible external validity to our findings, with implications for intervention scale-up. JEL Codes: O12, I12, I15, I18.},

"Homophily refers to the tendency of individuals to associate with others who have similar characteristics as themselves. This tendency has been observed across a variety of dimensions including ethnicity, age, gender, profession, and education level, among others. Given that our opinions, behaviors, and decisions are influenced by those we are in contact with, having a thorough grasp of homophily and how it shapes our social networks and ultimately translates into our behaviors becomes imperative.  This lecture proceeds in three parts. It begins with background on homophily, providing some illustrations and a very brief look at some empirical studies on homophily. It then proceeds to the impact of homophily, discussing the effects of homophily on three different things: how information diffuses through a society, how individuals make education decisions, and social mobility. After discussing the impact of homophily on these different behaviors, I conclude with a discussion of a model of homophily and what we might learn about what leads to homophily.},

abstract = {We develop a framework for nonparametrically identifying optimization frictions and structural elasticities using notches—discontinuities in the choice sets of agents—introduced by tax and transfer policies. Notches create excess bunching on the low-tax side and missing mass on the high-tax side of a cutoff, and they are often associated with a region of strictly dominated choice that would have zero mass in a frictionless world. By combining excess bunching (observed response attenuated by frictions) with missing mass in the dominated region (frictions), it is possible to uncover the structural elasticity that would govern behavior in the absence of frictions and arguably capture long-run behavior. We apply our framework to tax notches in Pakistan using rich administrative data. While observed bunching is large and sharp, optimization frictions are also very large as the majority of taxpayers in dominated ranges are unresponsive to tax incentives. The combination of large observed bunching and large frictions implies that the frictionless behavioral response to notches is extremely large, but the underlying structural elasticity driving this response is nevertheless modest. This highlights the inefficiency of notches: by creating extremely strong price distortions, they induce large behavioral responses even when structural elasticities are small.

@article{Manski1990,
abstract = {Assume that each member of a population is characterized by values for the variables (YA, YB' Z, x). Here x is a vector describing a person and z is a binary variable indicating which of two treatments this person receives. The treatments are labelled A and B. The variables YA and YB are scalar measures of the outcomes of the two treatments. For example, a cancer patient might be treated by (A) drug therapy or (B) surgery. The relevant outcome y might be life span following treatment. An unemployed worker might be given (A) vocational training or (B) job search assistance. Here the relevant outcome might be labor force status follow-ing treatment. Assume that a random sample is drawn and that one observes the realizations of (z, x) and of the outcome under the treat-ment received. Thus YA is observed if treat-ment A is received but is a latent variable if treatment B is received. Similarly, YB is either observed or latent. Suppose that one wants to learn the dif-ference in expected outcome if all persons with attributes x were assigned to treatment A or B. This "treatment effect" is (1) t(X) = E(yBIx)E(z Y X) = E(yBIx, z = A)P(z = A Ix) + E(YBIX, Z = B) P(Z = BlX) -E(YAIX, z = A) P(z = A Ix) -E(yAIx, z = B)P(z = BIx). The central problem is identification. The data are from a population in which some people described by x received treatment A and the rest received B. The sampling pro-cess identifies the expected outcomes under the treatment received, E(yAIx, z = A) and E(yB Ix, z = B). It also identifies the treat-ment-selection probabilities P(z I x). But, the sampling process does not identify E(yA Ix, z = B) and E(zBIX, z = A). Hence it does not identify the treatment effect. An extensive literature on the estimation of treatment effects brings to bear prior in-formation that, in conjunction with the sam-pling process, does identify t(x). (See, for example, G. S. Maddala, 1983, and James Heckman and Richard Robb, 1985.) Two approaches have been dominant. One as-sumes that, conditional on x, YA and YB are mean-independent of z (i.e., E(yA Ix, z = A)},

In a heterogeneous population, the fraction of consumers who violate WARP is not point identified but can be bounded. These bounds, as well as some nonparametric refinements, correspond to intuitive behavioral assumptions if there are two goods. With three or more goods, such intuitions break down, and plausible assumptions can have counterintuitive implications. We also provide estimators and confidence regions. The empirical application reveals that in the British Family Expenditure Survey, upper bounds are frequently positive but lower bounds are not significantly so.},

I embed a process where heterogeneous producers sequentially search across regions to determine where to sell their produce into a perfect competition Ricardian trade model. Information frictions explain the empirical failure of price arbitrage and provide new in- sight into how market conditions affect trade flows. Using a data set I assemble on regional agricultural trade in the Philippines, I show that observed trade flows and prices suggest the presence of substantial information frictions. I then structurally estimate the model to disentangle information frictions from transportation costs. I find that (1) estimated transportation costs are half as large as those implied by complete information models and more consistent with observed freight costs; and (2) the vast majority (93 percent) of the “gravity” relationship between trade flows and distance can be attributed to information frictions rather than transportation costs.},

@article{Semykina2010,
abstract = {We consider estimation of panel data models with sample selection when the equation of interest contains endogenous explanatory variables as well as unobserved heterogeneity. Assuming that appropriate instruments are available, we propose several tests for selection bias and two estimation procedures that correct for selection in the presence of endogenous regressors. The tests are based on the fixed effects two-stage least squares estimator, thereby permitting arbitrary correlation between unobserved heterogeneity and explanatory variables. The first correction procedure is parametric and is valid under the assumption that the errors in the selection equation are normally distributed. The second procedure estimates the model parameters semiparametrically using series estimators. In the proposed testing and correction procedures, the error terms may be heterogeneously distributed and serially dependent in both selection and primary equations. Because these methods allow for a rather flexible structure of the error variance and do not impose any nonstandard assumptions on the conditional distributions of explanatory variables, they provide a useful alternative to the existing approaches presented in the literature. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Banerjee2008c,
abstract = {We expect a lot from the middle classes. At least three distinct arguments about the special economic role of the middle class are traditionally made. In one, new entrepreneurs armed with a capacity and a tolerance for delayed gratification emerge from the middle class and create employment and productivity growth for the rest of society. In a second, perhaps more conventional view, the middle class is primarily a source of vital inputs for the entrepreneurial class: it is their "middle class values" -- their emphasis on the accumulation of human capital and savings -- that makes them central to the process of capitalist accumulation. The third view, a staple of the business press, emphasizes the middle class consumer, whose demand for quality consumer goods feeds investment in production and marketing, which in turn raises income levels for everyone. This essay asks what we should make of these arguments in the context of today's developing countries. We focus on two groups of households: those whose daily per capita expenditures are between $2 and $4, and those with expenditures between $6 and $10. These are the groups that we will call the middle class. Starting from survey data on patterns of consumption and investment by the middle class in thirteen developing countries, we look for what is distinct about the global middle class, especially when compared to the global poor (defined as those whose per capita daily consumption is below $2 a day). In particular, is there anything special about the way middle class people per spend their money, earn their incomes, or bring up their children?},

abstract = {Recently, economists have developed methods for structural estimation of auction models. Many researchers object to these methods because they find the strict rationality assumptions to be implausible. Using bid data from first-price auction experiments, we estimate four alternative structural models: (1) risk-neutral Bayes-Nash, (2) riskaverse Bayes-Nash, (3) a model of learning, and (4) a quantal response model of bidding. For each model, we compare the estimated valuations and the valuations assigned to bidders in the experiments. We find that the risk aversion model is able to generate reasonable estimates of bidder valuations.},

abstract = {Until now, studies of urbanization in India have been based only on official urban figures as provided by Census surveys. This approach has inevitably introduced several avoidable biases into the picture, distortions which are further compounded by numerous regional inter-Census adjustments. A much sounder option is now available in the Geopolis approach [www.e-geopolis.eu], which follows the United Nations system of classifying as urban all physical agglomerates with at least 10,000 inhabitants.From this standpoint, the Indian scenario exhibits all signs of a much-diffused process of urbanization rather than a major demographic polarization led by mega-cities. While 3,279 units were officially categorized as urban, the Geopolis criterion has identified 6,467 units with at least 10,000 inhabitants. Moreover, Geopolis estimates the urban population at 37% for 2001, which is 10% more than the official Census estimate. In absolute terms, this difference accounts for 100 million inhabitants. Brought to light by both physical identification and gradation of the census units of all localities as well as a study of the morphological profiles of individual agglomerates, a major finding reveals a greater spread of the country's metro and secondary cities than previously believed. Statistical and political considerations have obscured the emergence of small agglomerations of between 10,000 and 20,000 inhabitants. This omission can only be seen as a gap in the national policy on planning and urban development. In other words, the country seems to be firmly headed toward an extended process of metropolitanization alongside diffused combinations of localized socio-economic opportunities, clusters, cottage industries, and market towns partially interlinked by developmental corridors. Far from a dual model of modern versus traditional, urban versus rural, metro city versus small town, the Indian subcontinent features many sub-regional settings which converge, overlap, and diverge. This study of the distribution of current and emerging agglomerations challenges the pertinence of the urban/rural divide.},

This equivalence greatly simplifies the computational burden of calculating recursive out-of-sample tests and evalu-ating their critical values. Next, we show that the limit distribution, which has previously been expressed through stochastic integrals, has a simple representation in terms of $\chi$ 2 -distributed random variables and we derive the density of the limit distribution. We also generalize the limit theory to cover local alternatives and characterize the power properties of the test. Our results shed new light on the test and establish certain weaknesses associ-ated with using out-of-sample forecast comparison tests to conduct inference about nested regression models.},

@article{Atkinson2013,
abstract = {This paper develops a realistic, tractable theoretical model that can be used to investigate socially-optimal capital taxation. We present a dynamic model of savings and bequests with heterogeneous random tastes for bequests to children and for wealth per se. We derive formulas for optimal tax rates on capitalized inheritance expressed in terms of estimable parameters and social preferences. Under our model assumptions, the long-run optimal tax rate increases with the aggregate steady-state flow of inheritances to output, decreases with the elasticity of bequests to the net-of-tax rate, and decreases with the strength of preferences for leaving bequests. For realistic parameters of our model, the optimal tax rate on capitalized inheritance would be as high as 50%-60%–or even higher for top wealth holders–if the social objective is meritocratic (i.e., the social planner puts higher welfare weights on those receiving little inheritance) and if capital is highly concentrated (as it is in the real world). In contrast to the Atkinson-Stiglitz result, the optimal tax on bequest remains positive in our model even with optimal labor taxation because inequality is two-dimensional: with inheritances, labor income is no longer the unique determinant of lifetime resources. In contrast to Chamley-Judd, the optimal tax on capital is positive in our model because we have finite long run elasticities of inheritance to tax rates. Finally, we discuss how adding capital market imperfections and uninsurable shocks to rates of return to our optimal tax model leads to shifting one-off inheritance taxation toward lifetime capital taxation, and can account for the actual structure and mix of inheritance and capital taxation.},

abstract = {How much do migrants stand to gain in income from moving across borders? Answering this question is complicated by non-random selection of migrants from the general population, which makes it hard to obtain an appropriate comparison group of non-migrants. New Zealand allows a quota of Tongans to immigrate each year with a random ballot used to choose among the excess number of applicants. A unique survey conducted by the authors allows experimental estimates of the income gains from migration to be obtained by comparing the incomes of migrants to those who applied to migrate, but whose names were not drawn in the ballot, after allowing for the effect of non-compliance among some of those whose names were drawn. We also conducted a survey of individuals who did not apply for the ballot. Comparing this non-applicant group to the migrants enables assessment of the degree to which non-experimental methods can provide an unbiased estimate of the income gains from migration. We find evidence of migrants being positively selected in terms of both observed and unobserved skills. As a result, non-experimental methods other than instrumental variables are found to overstate the gains from migration by 20–82%, with difference-in-differences and bias-adjusted matching estimators performing best among the alternatives to instrumental variables.

abstract = {African agricultural markets are characterized by low revenues for smallholder farmers and high food prices for consumers. There has long been concern that this price wedge between farmers and consumers – and the resulting loss in producer and consumer welfare – are driven in part by imperfect competition among the intermediaries that connect them. In this paper, I implement three randomized control trials that are tightly linked to a model of market com- petition in order to estimate key parameters governing the competitive environment of Kenyan agricultural markets. First, I reduce the marginal costs of traders in randomly selected markets, and find that only 22% of this cost reduction is passed through to consumers. Second, to elicit the shape of consumer demand that these traders face, I randomize price discounts and measure the quantities that customers purchase at these prices. Taken together, these estimates reveal a high degree of collusion among intermediaries, with large implied losses to consumer welfare and overall market efficiency. Third, given that a natural policy response to limited competition is to encourage greater firm entry, I randomly incentivize the entry of new traders into markets. By capturing the resulting effect on local market prices, I identify the implied change in the competitive environment due to entry. I find that the estimates are consistent with a model in which entrants are able to easily join collusive agreements with incumbents. Taken together, the results suggest that agricultural traders in Kenya have considerable market power, and that marginal changes in market entry are unlikely to induce significant changes in competition. These findings have implications for the incidence of technological and infrastructure changes in African agriculture and for the policy responses aimed at improving the market environment. JEL},

In this paper, we analyze data for over 174,000 Indian and Sub-Saharan African children to show that Indian firstborns are taller than African firstborns; the Indian height disadvantage emerges with the second child and then increases with birth order. This pattern persists when we compare height between siblings, and also holds for health inputs such as vaccinations. Three patterns in the data indicate that India's culture of eldest son preference plays a key role in explaining the steeper birth order gradient among Indian children and, consequently, the overall height deficit. First, the Indian firstborn height advantage only exists for sons. Second, an Indian son with an older sibling is taller than his African counterpart if and only if he is the eldest son. Third, the India-Africa height deficit is largest for daughters with no older brothers, which reflects that fact that their families are those most likely to exceed their desired fertility in order to have a son.},

I find that match matters: moving a student from her worst to best match school doubles yearly average test score gains. Setting match-specific quality socially optimally in private schools would greatly reduce inequality in learning between rich and poor students while increasing learning and welfare. These positive effects are amplified when students' enrollment decisions are more responsive to quality.},

Yet, there is little evidence on the academic consequences of community college students' term-time employment. Using a rare administrative dataset from Washington State that combines students' quarterly transcript records with earning records from the state Unemployment Insurance system, this study relies on two causal strategies: first, an individual fixed effects strategy that takes advantage of the quarterly nature of the data to control for unobserved and time-invariant differences among students, and second, an instrumental variable–difference-in-differences framework that takes advantage of the fact that there is an exogenous supply of retail jobs during the winter holidays. The study compares academic outcomes in the fall and winter quarters for students who were more likely to work in retail and those less likely to work in retail based on pre-enrollment association with retail jobs. The findings reject the possibility of large negative effects for small increases in employment for community college students.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To describe our experience using satellite image-based sampling to conduct a health survey of children in an urban area of Lusaka, Zambia, as an approach to sampling when the population is poorly characterized by existing census data or maps. METHODS: Using a publicly available Quickbird image of several townships, we created digital records of structures within the residential urban study area using ArcGIS 9.2. Boundaries were drawn to create geographic subdivisions based on natural and man-made barriers (e.g. roads). Survey teams of biomedical research students and local community health workers followed a standard protocol to enroll children within the selected structure, or to move to the neighbouring structure if the selected structure was ineligible or refused enrollment. Spatial clustering was assessed using the K-difference function. RESULTS: Digital records of 16 105 structures within the study area were created. Of the 750 randomly selected structures, six (1%) were not found by the survey teams. A total of 1247 structures were assessed for eligibility, of which 691 eligible households were enrolled. The majority of enrolled households were the initially selected structures (51%) or the first selected neighbour (42%). Households that refused enrollment tended to cluster more than those which enrolled. CONCLUSIONS: Sampling from a satellite image was feasible in this urban African setting. Satellite images may be useful for public health surveillance in populations with inaccurate census data or maps and allow for spatial analyses such as identification of clustering among refusing households.},

This is unfortunate from a scientific point of view because heterogeneous treatment effects can provide additional substantive insights. This current state of affairs is also problematic from a policy makers' perspective since such studies do not identify subgroups for which treatments are effective. In this paper, we propose a formal two-step framework that first identifies heterogeneous treatment effects from a randomized experiment and then uses this information to derive an optimal policy about which treatment should be given to whom. Our proposed method avoids the risk of false discoveries that are likely in post hoc subgroup analysis routinely conducted in the discipline. We discuss our methodology in the context of get-out-the-vote randomized field experiments and show how the proposed two-step framework can be applied in real-world settings.},

abstract = {PM2.5 poses a serious threat to public health, however its spatial concentrations are not well characterized due to the sparseness of regulatory air quality monitoring (AQM) stations. This motivates novel low-cost methods to estimate ground-level PM2.5 at a fine spatial resolution so that PM2.5 exposure in epidemiological research can be better quantified. Satellite-retrieved aerosol products are widely used to estimate the spatial distribution of ground-level PM2.5. However, these aerosol products can be subject to large uncertainties due to many approximations and assumptions made in multiple stages of their retrieval algorithms. Therefore, estimating ground-level PM2.5 directly from satellites (e.g. satellite images) by skipping the intermediate step of aerosol retrieval can potentially yield lower errors because it avoids retrieval error propagating into PM2.5 estimation and is desirable compared to current ground-level PM2.5 retrieval methods. Additionally, the spatial resolutions of estimated PM2.5 are usually constrained by those of the aerosol products and are currently largely at a comparatively coarse 1 km or greater resolution. Such coarse spatial resolutions are unable to support scientific studies that thrive on highly spatially-resolved PM2.5. These limitations have motivated us to devise a computer vision algorithm for estimating ground-level PM2.5 at a high spatiotemporal resolution by directly processing the global-coverage, daily, near real-time updated, 3 m/pixel resolution, three-band micro-satellite imagery of spatial coverages significantly smaller than 1 × 1 km (e.g., 200 × 200 m) available from Planet Labs. In this study, we employ a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to process the imagery by extracting image features that characterize the day-to-day dynamic changes in the built environment and more importantly the image colors related to aerosol loading, and a random forest (RF) regressor to estimate PM2.5 based on the extracted image features along with meteorological conditions. We conducted the experiment on 35 AQM stations in Beijing over a period of $\sim$3 years from 2017 to 2019. We trained our CNN-RF model on 10,400 available daily images of the AQM stations labeled with the corresponding ground-truth PM2.5 and evaluated the model performance on 2622 holdout images. Our model estimates ground-level PM2.5 accurately at a 200 m spatial resolution with a mean absolute error (MAE) as low as 10.1 $\mu$g m−3 (equivalent to 23.7% error) and Pearson and Spearman r scores up to 0.91 and 0.90, respectively. Our trained CNN from Beijing is then applied to Shanghai, a similar urban area. By quickly retraining only RF but not CNN on the new Shanghai imagery dataset, our model estimates Shanghai 10 AQM stations' PM2.5 accurately with a MAE and both Pearson and Spearman r scores of 7.7 $\mu$g m−3 (18.6% error) and 0.85, respectively. The finest 200 m spatial resolution of ground-level PM2.5 estimates from our model in this study is higher than the vast majority of existing state-of-the-art satellite-based PM2.5 retrieval methods. And our 200 m model's estimation performance is also at the high end of these state-of-the-art methods. Our results highlight the potential of augmenting existing spatial predictors of PM2.5 with high-resolution satellite imagery to enhance the spatial resolution of PM2.5 estimates for a wide range of applications, including pollutant emission hotspot determination, PM2.5 exposure assessment, and fusion of satellite remote sensing and low-cost air quality sensor network information.},

abstract = {The UN Sustainable Development Goals allude to the importance of infrastructure quality in three of its seventeen goals. However, monitoring infrastructure quality in developing regions remains prohibitively expensive and impedes efforts to measure progress toward these goals. To this end, we investigate the use of widely available remote sensing data for the prediction of infrastructure quality in Africa. We train a convolutional neural network to predict ground truth labels from the Afrobarometer Round 6 survey using Landsat 8 and Sentinel 1 satellite imagery. Our best models predict infrastructure quality with AUROC scores of 0.881 on Electricity, 0.862 on Sewerage, 0.739 on Piped Water, and 0.786 on Roads using Landsat 8. These performances are significantly better than models that leverage OpenStreetMap or nighttime light intensity on the same tasks. We also demonstrate that our trained model can accurately make predictions in an unseen country after fine-tuning on a small sample of images. Furthermore, the model can be deployed in regions with limited samples to predict infrastructure outcomes with higher performance than nearest neighbor spatial interpolation.},

abstract = {In this paper, we provide efficient estimators and honest confidence bands for a variety of treatment effects including local average (LATE) and local quantile treatment effects (LQTE) in data-rich environments. We can handle very many control variables, endogenous receipt of treatment, heterogeneous treatment effects, and function-valued outcomes. Our framework covers the special case of exogenous receipt of treatment, either conditional on controls or unconditionally as in randomized control trials. In the latter case, our approach produces efficient estimators and honest bands for (functional) average treatment effects (ATE) and quantile treatment effects (QTE). To make informative inference possible, we assume that key reduced form predictive relationships are approximately sparse. This assumption allows the use of regularization and selection methods to estimate those relations, and we provide methods for post-regularization and post-selection inference that are uniformly valid (honest) across a wide-range of models. We show that a key ingredient enabling honest inference is the use of orthogonal or doubly robust moment conditions in estimating certain reduced form functional parameters. We illustrate the use of the proposed methods with an application to estimating the effect of 401(k) eligibility and participation on accumulated assets.},

We reexamine 57 AER papers and find that corrected inference causes half of the initially presumed statistically significant results to be insignificant. We introduce a more powerful test, the tF procedure, which provides F-dependent adjusted t-ratio critical values.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{Almond2010,
abstract = {A key policy question is whether the benefits of additional medical expen-ditures exceed their costs. We propose a new approach for estimating marginal returns to medical spending based on variation in medical inputs generated by diagnostic thresholds. Specifically, we combine regression discontinuity estimates that compare health outcomes and medical treatment provision for newborns on either side of the very low birth weight threshold at 1,500 grams. First, using data on the census of U.S. births in available years from 1983 to 2002, we find that newborns with birth weights just below 1,500 grams have lower one-year mortality rates than do newborns with birth weights just above this cutoff, even though mortality risk tends to decrease with birth weight. One-year mortality falls by approximately one percentage point as birth weight crosses 1,500 grams from above, which is large relative to mean infant mortality of 5.5% just above 1,500 grams. Second, using hospital discharge records for births in five states in available years from 1991 to 2006, we find that newborns with birth weights just below 1,500 grams have discontinuously higher charges and frequencies of specific medical inputs. Hospital costs increase by approximately $4,000 as birth weight crosses 1,500 grams from above, relative to mean hospital costs of $40,000 just above 1,500 grams. Under an assumption that observed medical spending fully captures the impact of the " very low birth weight " designation on mortality, our estimates suggest that the cost of saving a statistical life of a newborn with birth weight near 1,500 grams is on the order of $550,000 in 2006 dollars. * We thank Christine Pal and Jean Roth for assistance with the data, Christo-pher Afendulis and Ciaran Phibbs for data on California neonatal intensive care units, and doctors Christopher Almond, Burak Alsan, Munish Gupta, Chafen Hart, and Katherine Metcalf for helpful discussions regarding neonatology.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an alternative to maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of the censored regression (or censored 'Tobit') model. The proposed estimator is a generalization of least absolute deviations estimation for the standard linear model, and, unlike estimation methods based on the assumption of normally distributed error terms, the estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal for a wide class of error distributions, and is also robust to heteroscedasticity. The paper gives the regularity conditions and proofs of these large-sample results, and proposes classes of consistent estimators of the asymptotic covariance matrix for both homoscedastic and heteroscedastic disturbances. ?? 1984.},

@article{Deaton2016,
abstract = {The use of RCTs is spreading in economics. They are seen as desirable for discovery and for generating evidence for policy. Yet some of the enthusiasm for RCTs comes from misunderstandings: that randomization provides a fair test by equalizing everything but the treatment and so allows a precise estimate of the treatment alone; that randomization is required to solve selection problems; that lack of blinding does little to compromise inference; and that statistical inference in RCTs is straightforward, because it requires only the comparison of two means. RCTs do indeed require minimal assumptions and prior knowledge, an advantage when persuading distrustful audiences, but a crucial disadvantage for cumulative scientific progress, where randomization undermines precision. It is hard to use them outside of their original context. Yet, once they are seen as part of a cumulative program, they can play a role in building general knowledge and useful predictions, provided they are combined with other methods, including conceptual and theoretical development, to discover not “what works,” but why things work. Unless we are prepared to make assumptions, and to stand on what we know, making statements that will be incredible to some, all the credibility of RCTs is for naught.},

abstract = {The literature on aid and growth has not found a convincing instrumental variable to identify the causal effects of aid. In this paper we exploit an instrumental variable based on the fact that since 1987, a major criterion for IDA (International Development Association) eligibility has been whether or not a country is below a certain threshold of per capita income. We find evidence that other donors tend to reinforce rather than compensate for reductions in IDA aid following threshold crossings. Overall, the aid to GNI ratio drops about 59% on average after countries cross the threshold. Focusing on the 35 countries that have crossed the IDA income threshold from below between 1987 and 2010, we find a positive, statistically significant, and economically sizable effect of aid on growth. A one percentage point increase in the aid to GNI ratio from the sample mean raises annual real per capita GDP growth by approximately 0.35 percentage points. We show that the main channel through which aid promotes growth is by increasing physical investment.},

To attack this problem, we design a convolutional network with a final stage that integrates activations from multiple preceding stages for pixel-wise prediction, and introduce the signed distance function of building boundaries as the output representation, which has an enhanced representation power. We leverage abundant building footprint data available from geographic information systems (GIS) to compile training data. The trained network achieves superior performance on datasets that are significantly larger and more complex than those used in prior work, demonstrating that the proposed method provides a promising and scalable solution for automating this labor-intensive task.},

abstract = {In this paper, I discuss, what I call, the Production-Approach to recovering markups. In contrast to the most popular approach in empirical IO, which relies on demand estimation, this approach requires standard production data while allowing for various price-setting models and puts no restrictions on underlying consumer demand. Using production data together with standard cost minimization allows a researcher to obtain markups in a flexible way. After presenting a brief and selective overview of the literature I contrast the production approach to that of the more popular demand estimation approach. This discussion makes it clear that both approaches face important trade-offs and at a minimum empirical economist should have both techniques as part of their toolbox. The hope is that the use of both methods will only depend on the data at hand and the relevant institutional knowledge, paired with the actual research question we are trying to answer. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Gradients across socio-economic position exist for many measures of children's health and development in higher-income countries. These associations may not be consistent, however, among the millions of children living in lower- and middle-income countries. Our objective was to examine child development and growth in young children across socio-economic position in four developing countries. We used cross-sectional surveys, child development assessments, measures of length (LAZ), and home stimulation (Family Care Index) of children in India, Indonesia, Peru, and Senegal. The Extended Ages and Stages Questionnaire (EASQ) was administered to parents of all children ages 3-23 mo in the household (n =8,727), and length measurements were taken for all children 0-23 mo (n = 11,102). Household wealth and maternal education contributed significantly and independently to the variance in EASQ and LAZ scores in all countries, while controlling for child's age and sex, mother's age and marital status, and household size. Being in the fifth wealth quintile in comparison with the first quintile was associated with significantly higher EASQ scores (0.27 to 0.48 of a standardized score) and higher LAZ scores (0.37 to 0.65 of a standardized score) in each country, while controlling for maternal education and covariates. Wealth and education gradients increased over the first two years in most countries for both EASQ and LAZ scores, with larger gradients seen in 16-23-mo-olds than in 0-7 mo-olds. Mediation analyses revealed that parental home stimulation activities and LAZ were significant mediating variables and explained up to 50% of the wealth effects on the EASQ.},

abstract = {Carter, Kofler, Forster, & McCullough (2015) conducted a bias-corrected meta-analysis of the so-called ego depletion effect to determine its real size and robustness. Their efforts have raised awareness of how badly meta-analyses can mislead when the articles that go into them are products of publication bias. Despite our genuine enthusiasm for their work, we worry that in their zeal to correct the record of publication bias, they have drawn too heavily on largely untested statistical techniques that can be insensitive and sometimes misleading. We tested a set of bias-correction techniques, including those favored by Carter and colleagues, by simulating 40,000 meta-analyses in a range of situations that approximate what is found in the ego depletion literature, most notably the presence of heterogeneous effects filtered by publication bias. Our simulations revealed that not one of the bias-correction techniques revealed itself superior in all conditions, with corrections performing adequately in some situations but inadequately in others. Such a result implies that meta-analysts ought to present a range of possible effect sizes and to consider them all as being possible. The problem with the ego depletion literature is that the bias- corrected estimates for the overall effect do not converge, with estimates ranging from g=0 to g=0.24 to g=0.26. Despite our admiration for this program of meta-research, we suggest that bias-corrected meta-analyses cannot yet resolve whether the overall ego depletion is different from zero or not.},

abstract = {Because some are not able to assess all the possible options for making a decision of an action, people often defy one of the most fundamental and traditional concepts in economics by going for an option that they would not have chosen had they been able to push through with thorough evaluation. Because of this, it would be useful to first analyze the common mistakes made until they become uncommon and until we are able to integrate what we have learned from these mistakes into creating models, policy prescriptions, and evaluations. Although certain fears may arise from such a measure on both the positive and normative side through mistakes becoming a free parameter and because of how the revealed-preference approach cannot be used, this chapter suggests other measures to deal with such concerns.},

abstract = {We provide a novel approach to estimate the deadweight loss of congestion. We implement it for road travel in the city of Bogot{\'{a}} using information from a travel survey and counterfactual travel data generated from Google Maps. For the supply of travel, we find that the elasticity of the time cost of travel per unit of distance with respect to the number of travelers is on average about 0.06. It is close to zero at low levels of traffic, then reaches a maximum magnitude of about 0.20 as traffic builds up and becomes small again at high levels of traffic. This finding is in sharp contrast with extant results for specific road segments. We explain it by the existence of local streets which remain relatively uncongested and put a floor on the time cost of travel. On the demand side, we estimate an elasticity of the number of travelers with respect to the time cost of travel of 0.40. Although road travel is costly in Bogot{\'{a}}, these findings imply a small daily deadweight loss from congestion, equal to less than 1% of a day's wage.},

abstract = {Using data on formal manufacturing plants in India, we report a large but imprecise speedup in productivity growth starting in the early 1990s (e.g., 1993-2007 compared to 1980-1992). We trace it to productivity growth within large plants (200 workers or more), as opposed to reallocation across such plants. As many economists believe Indian reforms during this era improved resource allocation, the absence of a growth pickup from reallocation is surprising. Moreover, when we look across industries we fail to robustly relate productivity growth to prominent reforms such as industrial de-licensing, tariff reductions, FDI liberalization, or lifting of small-scale industry reservations. Even under a generous reading of their effects, these reforms (at least as we measure them) account for less than one-third of the rapid productivity growth in Indian manufacturing from 1980-2007. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Individuals have types and see type-dependent benefits from friendships. We examine the properties of a steady-state equilibrium of a matching process of friendship formation. We use the model to understand three empirical patterns of friendship formation: (i) larger groups tend to form more same-type ties and fewer other-type ties than small groups, (ii) larger groups form more ties per capita, and (iii) all groups are biased towards same-type relative to demographics, with the most extreme bias coming from middle-sized groups. We show how these empirical observations can be generated by biases in preferences and biases in meetings. We also illustrate some welfare implications of the model. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Econometric Society.},

Similarly, once institutions are controlled for, trade is almost always insignificant, and often enters the income equation with the "wrong" (i.e., negative) sign, although trade too has a positive effect on institutional quality.

Firms make endogenous entry and exit decisions and each surviving firm chooses optimally the range of products to supply to each market. We showthat the resulting selection, across and within firms, provides a natural explanation for a number of features of trade across firms, products, andcountries. Usingbothtime-series changes intradepolicyand cross-section variation in trade, we provide empirical evidence in support of the predictions of themodel.},

@article{Laibson2015,
abstract = {There are many great ways to incorporate behavioral economics in a first-year under-graduate economics class—i.e., the course that is typically called " Principles of Economics. " Our preferred approach integrates behavioral economics throughout the course (e.g., see Acemoglu, Laibson, and List 2015). With the integrated approach, behavioral content plays a role in many of the chapters of the principles of economics curriculum, including chapters on optimization, equilibrium, game theory, inter-temporal choice, probability and risk, social preferences, household finance, the labor mar-ket, financial intermediation, monetary policy, economic fluctuations, and financial crises. We prefer the integrated approach because it enables the behavioral insights to show up where they are conceptually most relevant. By illustra-tion, it is best to combine a discussion of down-ward nominal wage rigidity (i.e., the idea that workers strongly resist nominal wage declines) with the overall discussion of the labor market. Whether or not an instructor integrates behav-ioral economics throughout the principles of economics course, it makes sense to pull cen-tral materials together and dedicate a lecture (or more) to a focused discussion of behavioral economics. This note describes our approach to such a lecture, emphasizing six key principles of behavioral economics. Our choice of content for a behavioral lecture is motivated by three factors. First, we include ideas that are conceptually important. Second, we include material that is practically import-ant and personally relevant to our students—we have found that such content resonates long after the course ends. Third, we include content that relates to what has been (or will be) taught in the rest of the course, and therefore serves as a com-plement. We want students to see that behavioral economics is an integrated part of economics, not a freak show that is isolated from " the standard ingredients " in the rest of the economics course. This paper summarizes our approach to such a focused behavioral lecture. In Section I, we define behavioral economics and place it in his-torical context. In Section II, we introduce six modular principles that can be used to teach behavioral economics. We provide PowerPoint notes on our home pages, which instructors should feel free to edit and use.},

abstract = {This paper studies the response of poor rural households in rural Kenya to large temporary income changes. Using a randomized controlled trial, households were randomly assigned to receive unconditional cash transfers of at least USD 404 from the NGO GiveDirectly. We designed the experiment to address several long-standing questions in the economics literature: what is the shape of households' Engel curves? Do household members effectively pool income? Are there constraints to savings? Do transfers generate externalities? In addition, we study in detail the effects of transfers on psychological well-being and levels of the stress hormone cortisol. We randomized at both the village and household levels; further, within the treatment group, we randomized recipient gender (wife vs. husband), transfer timing (lump-sum transfer vs. monthly installments over 9 months), and transfer magnitude (USD 404 vs. USD 1,520). We find a strong consumption response to transfers, with an increase in monthly consumption from USD 157 to USD 194 four months after the transfer ended. Implied expenditure elasticities for food, medical and education expenditures range between 0.84 and 1.47, while the point estimates are negative for alcohol and tobacco. Intriguingly, recipient gender does not affect the household response to the program. Households may face savings constraints: monthly transfers are more likely than lump-sum transfers to improve food security, while lump-sum transfers are more likely to be spent on durables. We find no evidence for externalities on non-recipients except for a significant positive spillover on female empowerment. Transfer recipients experience large increases in psychological well-being, and several types of transfers lead to reductions in levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Together, these results suggest that unconditional cash transfers have significant impacts on consumption and psychological well-being.},

Using a variety of methods to analyze employment in all sectors paying below a specified real hourly rate, we conclude that the second wage increase to $13 reduced hours worked in low-wage jobs by around 9 percent, while hourly wages in such jobs increased by around 3 percent. Consequently, total payroll fell for such jobs, implying that the minimum wage ordinance lowered low-wage employees' earnings by an average of $125 per month in 2016. Evidence attributes more modest effects to the first wage increase. We estimate an effect of zero when analyzing employment in the restaurant industry at all wage levels, comparable to many prior studies.},

abstract = {This chapter surveys existing approaches to modeling labor supply and identifies important gaps in the literature that could be addressed in future research. The discussion begins with a look at recent policy reforms and labor market facts that motivate the study of labor supply. The analysis then presents a unifying framework that allows alternative empirical formulations of the labor supply model to be compared and their resulting elasticities to be interpreted. This is followed by critical reviews of alternative approaches to labor-supply modeling. The first review assesses the difference-in-differences approach and its relationship to natural experiments. The second analyzes estimation with non-linear budget constraints and welfare-program participation. The third appraises developments of family labor-supply models including both the standard unitary and collective labor-supply formulations. The fourth briefly explores dynamic extensions of the labor supply model, characterizing how participation decisions, learning-by-doing, human capital accumulation and habit formation affect the analysis of the lifecycle model. At the end of each of the four broad reviews, we summarize a selection of the recent empirical findings. The concluding section asks whether the developments reviewed in this chapter place us in a better position to answer the policy-reform questions and to interpret the trends in participation and hours with which we began this review. {\textcopyright} 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

We assessed a nationally representative sample of 3-6-year-old children (n = 1332) from 150 communities of Madagascar using standard tests of development. We found that children whose families were in the top wealth quintile or whose mothers had secondary education performed significantly better across almost all measures of cognitive and language development and had better linear growth compared with children of women in the lowest wealth quintile or women with no education. These differences between children of low and high socioeconomic position were greatest for receptive language, working memory, and memory of phrases. The mean difference in the scores between children in the highest and lowest socioeconomic status categories doubled between age 3 and age 6, and the biggest gaps across socioeconomic position by age 6 were in receptive language and sustained attention. Our results suggest that even within the context of extreme poverty, there are strong associations between family socioeconomic status and child development outcomes among preschool children, and that the language and executive function domains exhibit the largest gradients.},

abstract = {This article suggests very simple three-step estimators for censored quantile regression models with a separation restriction on the censoring probability. The estimators are theoretically attractive (i.e., asymptotically as efficient as the celebrated Powell's censored least absolute deviation estimator). At the same time, they are conceptually simple and have trivial computational expenses. They are especially useful in samples of small size or models with many regressors, with desirable finite-sample properties and small bias. The separation restriction costs a small reduction of generality relative to the canonical censored regression quantile model, yet its main plausible features remain intact. The estimator can also be used to estimate a large class of traditional models, including the normal Amemiya-Tobin model and many accelerated failure and proportional hazard models. We illustrate the approach with an extramarital affairs example and contrast our findings with those of Fair.},

@book{Piketty2013,
abstract = {This handbook chapter reviews recent developments in the theory of optimal labor income taxation. We emphasize connections between theory and empirical work that were initially lacking from optimal income tax theory. First, we provide historical and international background on labor income taxation and means-tested transfers. Second, we present the simple model of optimal linear taxation. Third, we consider optimal nonlinear income taxation with particular emphasis on the optimal top tax rate and the optimal profile of means-tested transfers. Fourth, we consider various extensions of the standard model including tax avoidance and income shifting, international migration, models with rent-seeking, relative income concerns, the treatment of couples and children, and non-cash transfers. Finally, we discuss limitations of the standard utilitarian approach and briefly review alternatives. In all cases, we use the simplest possible models and show how optimal tax formulas can be derived and expressed in terms of sufficient statistics that include social marginal welfare weights capturing society's value for redistribution, behavioral elasticities capturing the efficiency costs of taxation, as well as parameters of the earnings distribution. We also emphasize connections between actual practice and the predictions from theory, and in particular the limitations of both theory and empirical work in settling the political debate on optimal labor income taxation and transfers. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Belloni2013a,
abstract = {We propose robust methods for inference about the effect of a treatment variable on a scalar outcome in the presence of very many regressors in a model with possibly non-Gaussian and heteroscedastic disturbances.We allow for the number of regressors to be larger than the sample size.To make informative inference feasible, we require the model to be approximately sparse; that is, we require that the effect of confounding factors can be controlled for up to a small approximation error by including a relatively small number of variables whose identities are unknown. The latter condition makes it possible to estimate the treatment effect by selecting approximately the right set of regressors.We develop a novel estimation and uniformly valid inference method for the treatment effect in this setting, called the “post-double-selection” method. The main attractive feature of our method is that it allows for imperfect selection of the controls and provides confidence intervals that are valid uniformly across a large class of models. In contrast, standard post-model selection estimators fail to provide uniform inference even in simple cases with a small, fixed number of controls. Thus, our method resolves the problem of uniform inference after model selection for a large, interesting class of models.We also present a generalization of our method to a fully heterogeneous model with a binary treatment variable. We illustrate the use of the developed methods with numerical simulations and an application that considers the effect of abortion on crime rates. Key},

We identify the distribution of demand both unconditional and conditional on market observables, which allows us to identify several quantities of economic interest such as the (conditional and unconditional) distributions of elasticities and the distribution of price effects following a merger. Our approach is based on a significant generalization of the linear in random coefficients model that only restricts the random functions to be analytic in the endogenous variables, which is satisfied by several standard demand models used in practice. We assume an (unknown) countable support for the the distribution of the infinite dimensional unobservables.},

abstract = {The largest cities in the world today lie mainly in poor countries, which is a departure from historical experience, when they were typically found in the richest places. We use new demographic data to establish several stylized facts distinguishing poor mega-cities from historically rich mega-cities. To account for these facts we develop a model that combines Malthusian models of endogenous population growth with urban models of agglomeration and congestion, and it shows that a city's absolute population growth can determine whether it becomes a poor or rich mega-city. We posit that poor mega-cities arose because the post- war mortality transition dramatically lowered their mortality rates and raised their absolute growth above a crucial threshold. They then continued to grow in size but not in living standards because their poverty kept their fertility rates high. Poor mega-cities thus grew precisely because they were poor.},

We consider several types of income changes: Ramadan, weather shocks, a labor reform and returns to time in the UAE. We demonstrate that two key characteristics of the income changes that affect the income elasticity of remittances are the observability of the income and whether the income change is positive or negative. The results are consistent with a private information model where remittances are viewed as payments in an income-sharing contract.},

abstract = {The conventional wisdom in health economics is that large differences in average productivity across hospitals are the result of idiosyncratic, institutional features of the healthcare sector which dull the role of market forces. Strikingly, however, we find that productivity dispersion in heart attack treatment across hospitals is, if anything, smaller than in narrowly defined manufacturing industries such as ready-mixed concrete. While this fact admits multiple interpretations, we also find evidence against the conventional wisdom that the healthcare sector does not operate like an industry subject to standard market forces. In particular, we find that hospitals that are more productive at treating heart attacks have higher market shares at a point in time and are more likely to expand over time. For example, a 10 percent increase in hospital productivity today is associated with about 4 percent more patients in 5 years. Taken together, these facts suggest that the healthcare sector may have more in common with “traditional” sectors than is often assumed.},

abstract = {This study estimates long-run impacts of a child health investment, exploiting community-wide experimental variation in school-based deworming. The program increased labor supply among men and education among women, with accompanying shifts in labor market specialization. Ten years after deworming treatment, men who were eligible as boys stay enrolled for more years of primary school, work 17% more hours each week, spend more time in nonagricultural self-employment, are more likely to hold manufacturing jobs, and miss one fewer meal per week. Women who were in treatment schools as girls are approximately one quarter more likely to have attended secondary school, halving the gender gap. They reallocate time from traditional agriculture into cash crops and nonagricultural self-employment. We estimate a conservative annualized financial internal rate of return to deworming of 32%, and show that mass deworming may generate more in future government revenue than it costs in subsidies.

Adifference-in-differences analysis reveals that this reform raised the test scores of poor children significantly and closed the gap between these students and the rest of the population by one third. I estimate an empiricalmodel of school choice to construct counter-factual simulations that allow me to isolate the different mechanisms through which this policy affected outcomes. In addition, the explicit modeling of schools' choice of price and quality allows for the analysis of how the policy changed the nature of competition among schools. The model estimates imply that the observed policy effect is due mostly to the increase in the quality of schools in poor neighborhoods and not to a resorting of students to better schools or the entry of new higher-quality schools. The introduction of targeted vouchers is shown to have effectively raised competition in poor neighborhoods, pushing schools to improve their academic quality},

abstract = {This article brings a historical perspective to explain the recent dissemination of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as the new “gold standard” method to assess international development projects. Although the buzz around RCT evaluations dates from the 2000s, we show that what we are witnessing now is a second wave of RCTs, while a first wave began in the 1960s and ended by the early 1980s. Drawing on content analysis of 123 RCTs, participant observation, and secondary sources, we compare the two waves in terms of the participants in the network of expertise required to carry out field experiments and the characteristics of the projects evaluated. The comparison demonstrates that researchers in the second wave were better positioned to navigate the political difficulties caused by randomization. We explain the differences in the expertise network and in the type of projects as the result of concurrent transformations in the fields of development aid and the economics profession. We draw on Andrew Abbott's concept of “hinges,” as well as on Bourdieu's concept of “homology” between fields, to argue that the similar positions and parallel struggles conducted by two groups of actors in the two fields served as the basis for a cross-field alliance, in which RCTs could function as a “hinge” linking together the two fields.},

This mechanism is based on the relative costs of dismissing young versus older workers resulting from job security provisions that are related to tenure. Using 39 consecutive annual household surveys from Chile, we find that job security is associated with a substantial decline in the wage employment-to-population rate of young workers. In contrast, we do not find such decline in young self-employment rates or in the wage-employment rates of older workers. Our results also indicate that the negative effect on youth employment rate is driven by the slope of the severance-pay profile. Regarding aggregate employment rates, we find that a raise in tenure-based severance pay reduces long-run employment, while a raise in a flat severance pay would marginally increase it.},

abstract = {A new basis for an international poverty measurement is proposed based on linear programming for specifying the least cost diet and explicit budgeting for nonfood spending. This approach is superior to the World Bank's $1-a-day line because it is (i) clearly related to sur-vival and well being; (ii) comparable across time and space since the same nutritional requirements are used everywhere while nonfood spending is tailored to climate; (iii) adjusts consumption patterns to local prices; (iv) presents no index number problems since solutions are always in local prices; and (v) requires only readily available information. The new approach implies much more poverty than the World Bank's, especially in Asia. (JEL C61, I14, I31, I32, O15) The World Bank's famous $1-a-day poverty line began life as the finding of a scientific inquiry in the 1980s, became the Bank's metric for measuring pov-erty in 1990, and reached full maturity when it was enshrined in the Millennium Development Goals as the standard for tracking poverty around the world. However, the line rests on contestable foundations that give rise to a host of theoretical and practical problems as well as leading, we argue, to underestimates of poverty in much of the developing world.},

abstract = {Individual outcomes are highly correlated with group average outcomes, a fact often interpreted as a causal peer effect. Without covariates, however, outcome-on-outcome peer effects are vacuous, either unity or, if the average is defined as a leave-out mean, determined by a generic intraclass correlation coefficient. When pre-determined peer characteristics are introduced as covariates in a model linking individual outcomes with group averages, the question of whether peer effects or social spillovers exist is econometrically identical to that of whether a 2SLS estimator using group dummies to instrument individual characteristics differs from OLS estimates of the effect of these characteristics. The interpretation of results from models that rely solely on chance variation in peer groups is therefore complicated by bias from weak instruments. With systematic variation in group composition, the weak IV issue falls away, but the resulting 2SLS estimates can be expected to exceed the corresponding OLS estimates as a result of measurement error and for other reasons unrelated to social effects. Research designs that manipulate peer characteristics in a manner unrelated to individual characteristics provide the most compelling evidence on the nature of social spillovers. As an empirical matter, designs of this sort have mostly uncovered little in the way of socially significant causal effects.},

abstract = {Low rates of adoption of and low willingness to pay for preventative health technologies pose an ongoing puzzle in development economics. In the case of water-borne disease, the burden is high both in terms of poor health and cost of treatment. Inexpensive preventative technologies exist, but willingness to pay (WTP) has been observed to be low in a number of contexts. We study the effect of time payments (micro-loans or dedicated micro-savings) on WTP for a ceramic water filter among 400 households in slums of Dhaka, Bangladesh. We use a modified Becker-Degroot-Marschak mechanism to elicit WTP from each household across several different payment plans. We obtain valuations from each household across all payment plans, which allows us to investigate the mechanisms behind differences in WTP across plans. We find that time payments significantly increase WTP: compared to a lump-sum up-front purchase, median WTP increases 83% with a six-month loan and 115% with a 12-month loan. Similarly, coverage can be greatly increased: at an unsubsidized price (50% subsidy) coverage is 12% (27%) under a lump-sum but as high as 45% (71%) given time payments. We use our rich within-household WTP data, the design of the payment plans, and a simple structural model of time preference and credit constraints to investigate the mechanisms. We find that households are patient with respect to consumption of health inputs, but do exhibit impatience with respect to general consumption.

abstract = {Both in insurance and in finance applications, questions involving extremal events (such as large insurance claims, large fluctuations, in financial data, stock-market shocks, risk management, ...) play an increasingly important role. This much awaited book presents a comprehensive development of extreme value methodology for random walk models, time series, certain types of continuous-time stochastic processes and compound Poisson processes, all models which standardly occur in applications in insurance mathematics and mathematical finance. Both probabilistic and statistical methods are discussed in detail, with such topics as ruin theory for large claim models, fluctuation theory of sums and extremes of iid sequences, extremes in time series models, point process methods, statistical estimation of tail probabilities. Besides summarising and bringing together known results, the book also features topics that appear for the first time in textbook form, including the theory of subexponential distributions and the spectral theory of heavy-tailed time series. A typical chapter will introduce the new methodology in a rather intuitive (tough always mathematically correct) way, stressing the understanding of new techniques rather than following the usual "theorem-proof" format. Many examples, mainly from applications in insurance and finance, help to convey the usefulness of the new material. A final chapter on more extensive applications and/or related fields broadens the scope further. The book can serve either as a text for a graduate course on stochastics, insurance or mathematical finance, or as a basic reference source. Its reference quality is enhanced by a very extensive bibliography, annotated by various comments sections making the book broadly and easily accessible.},

abstract = {Exploring treatment heterogeneity can pro-vide valuable information about how to improve program targeting and what mechanisms drive results. But ad hoc searches for particu-larly responsive subgroups may mistake noise for a true treatment effect. Committing to a preregistered analysis plan can protect against claims of data mining or p-hacking but may also prevent researchers from discovering unantic-ipated results and developing new hypotheses. Modern corrections for multiple hypothesis test-ing are a useful alternative, though in practice they can be quite conservative when used across more than a few dimensions of heterogeneity. Recent developments in the machine learning literature may help identify treatment hetero-geneity in a principled way. Athey and Imbens (2016) and Wager and Athey (2015) extend regression tree and random forest algorithms to the problem of estimating average treatment effects for different subgroups, building on a large literature about estimating personalized treatment effects in medicine. If these methods adequately predict variation in treatment effects based on observable characteristics, they could provide more flexibility and better prediction of treatment heterogeneity by searching over high-dimensional functions of covariates rather than a small number of subgroups (typically defined by one or two interaction terms). We apply Wager and Athey's (2015) causal forest algorithm to data from two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the same summer jobs program. Policymakers regularly make decisions about whom to serve in youth employ-ment programs, so understanding how differ-ent subpopulations respond is substantively important in this context. Our setting is also a technically useful application because eligibil-ity criteria were deliberately changed across the two RCTs to test for treatment heterogeneity; the studies have relatively large sample sizes for social experiments (1,634 and 5,216 observa-tions, respectively); and we observe a large set of covariates. Since this is an early application of the method, we focus our discussion on a step-by-step explanation of the process targeted at applied researchers. We explore how useful the predicted heterogeneity is in practice by testing whether youth with larger predicted treatment effects actually respond more in a hold-out sample. We conclude that although the method is likely to work best with datasets that are larger than our post-hold-out sample, it can identify treatment heterogeneity for some outcomes that typical interaction effects with adjustments for multiple testing would have missed.},

abstract = {Many governments have spent much of the past decade trying to extend a helping hand to informal businesses by making it easier and cheaper for them to formalize. Much less effort has been devoted to raising the costs of remaining informal, through increasing enforcement of existing regulations. This paper reports on a field experiment conducted in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, in order to test which government actions work in getting informal firms to register. Firms were randomized to a control group or one of four treatment groups: the first received information about how to formalize; the second received this information and free registration costs along with the use of an accountant for a year; the third group was assigned to receive an enforcement visit from a municipal inspector; while the fourth group was assigned to have a neighboring firm receive an enforcement visit to see if enforcement has spillovers. The analysis finds zero or negative impacts of information and free cost treatments, and a significant but small increase in formalization from inspections. Estimates of the impact of actually receiving an inspection give a 21 to 27 percentage point increase in the likelihood of formalizing. The results show most informal firms will not formalize unless forced to do so, suggesting formality offers little private benefit to them. But the tax revenue benefits to the government of bringing firms of this size into the formal system more than offset the costs of inspections.},

abstract = {—In order to map the spatial extent and location of slum settlements multiple methodologies have been devised including remote sensing based methods and field based methods using surveys and census data. In this study we utilize spatial, structural, and contextual features (e.g., PanTex, Histogram of Oriented Gradients, Line Support Regions, Hough transforms and others) calculated at multiple spatial scales from high spatial resolution satellite data to map slum areas and compare these estimates to three field based slum maps: one from the UN Habitat/Accra Metropolitan Assembly (UNAMA) and two census data derived maps based on the UN Habitat definition of a slum, a simple slum/non-slum dichotomy map, and a slum index map. When comparing the remotely sensed derived slum areas to the UNAMA slum definition results indicate an overall accuracy of 94.3% and a Kappa of 0.91. When compared to the dichotomous, census derived slum maps the results are not as accurate. This reduced accuracy is due to the substantial over prediction of slums, especially if only one criterion was missing, using the census data. In relation to the slum index, the remote sensing estimates of slums were significantly correlated with an r2 of 0.45 and when population density was taken into account, the correlation increased to an r2 of 0.78. Overall, the remote sensing methodology provides a reasonable estimate of slum areas and variations within the city. I.},

abstract = {It is known that Fe deficiency has a negative impact on cognitive function in children by altering brain energy metabolism and neurotransmitter function. It is unclear whether Fe deficiency has detrimental effects on cognition, mental health and fatigue in women of childbearing age. Our aim was to systematically review the literature to determine whether Fe deficiency in women of childbearing age affects cognition, mental health and fatigue, and whether a change in Fe status results in improvements in cognition, mental health and fatigue. Studies using Fe supplement interventions were reviewed to examine the effect of Fe deficiency in women of childbearing age (13-45 years) on their cognition, mental health and fatigue. English-language articles ranging from the earliest record to the year 2011 were sourced. The quality of retrieved articles was assessed and the Fe pathology, cognitive, mental health and fatigue data were extracted. Means and standard deviations from cognitive test data were included in meta-analyses of combined effects. Of the 1348 studies identified, ten were included in the review. Three studies showed poorer cognition and mental health scores and increased fatigue with Fe deficiency at baseline. Seven studies reported an improvement in cognitive test scores after Fe treatment. Results of three of these studies were included in meta-analyses of the effect of Fe supplement intervention on cognition. The results of the meta-analyses showed a significant improvement in Arithmetic scores after treatment (P < 0{\textperiodcentered}01), but no effect on Digit Symbol, Digit Span or Block Design. While an improvement in cognition after Fe treatment was seen in seven out of ten studies, the evidence base is limited by poor study quality and heterogeneity across studies. Additional high-quality studies using consistent measures are warranted.},

Here we demonstrate an accurate, inexpensive, and scalable method for estimating consumption expenditure and asset wealth from high-resolution satellite imagery. Using survey and satellite data from five African countries--Nigeria, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, and Rwanda--we show how a convolutional neural network can be trained to identify image features that can explain up to 75% of the variation in local-level economic outcomes. Our method, which requires only publicly available data, could transform efforts to track and target poverty in developing countries. It also demonstrates how powerful machine learning techniques can be applied in a setting with limited training data, suggesting broad potential application across many scientific domains.},

abstract = {Field experiments and simulation models are useful tools for understanding crop yield gaps, but scaling up these approaches to understand entire regions over time has remained a considerable challenge. Satellite data have repeatedly been shown to provide information that, by themselves or in combination with other data and models, can accurately measure crop yields in farmers' fields. The resulting yield maps provide a unique opportunity to overcome both spatial and temporal scaling challenges and thus improve understanding of crop yield gaps. This review discusses the use of remote sensing to measure the magnitude and causes of yield gaps. Examples from previous work demonstrate the utility of remote sensing, but many areas of possible application remain unexplored. Two simple yet useful approaches are presented that measure the persistence of yield differences between fields, which in combination with maps of average yields can be used to direct further study of specific factors. Whereas the use of remote sensing may have historically been restricted by the cost and availability of fine resolution data, this impediment is rapidly receding. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Urban workers in Kenya earn twice as much as rural workers with the same level of education. Why don't more rural workers migrate to cities? In this paper, I use two field experiments to show that low migration is partly due to underestimation of urban incomes by rural Kenyans, and that this inaccurate information can be sustained by migrants' strategic motives to hide income to minimize remittance obligations. I first show that rural Kenyans underestimate big-city incomes considerably, despite the fact that two-thirds of households have a member who has migrated in the past. Parents underestimate their migrant children's incomes by 50% on average, and underestimation is larger when the migrant's incentive to hide income is high-in particular, when parents believe remittance obligations are high and when migrants have no stated desire to induce additional migration. In a first experiment that provides rural households with urban labor market information, treated households update their beliefs about the returns to migration and are 8 percentage points more likely to send a migrant to Nairobi. In a second field experiment, I directly test whether hidden income is distorting the decision to migrate by randomly informing rural households about the extent of hidden income among urban migrants. I find that hidden income dampens migration aspirations: learning about the average degree of hidden income increases planned migration to Nairobi by 13 percentage points.},

abstract = {Cash transfer programs have become extremely popular in the developing world. A large literature analyzes their effects on schooling, health and nutrition, but relatively little is known about possible impacts on child development. This paper analyzes the impact of a cash transfer program on early childhood cognitive development. Children in households randomly assigned to receive benefits had significantly higher levels of development nine months after the program began. There is no fade-out of program effects two years after the program ended. Additional random variation shows that these impacts are unlikely to result from the cash component of the program alone.

abstract = {We show that the effects of taxes on labor supply are shaped by interactions between adjustment costs for workers and hours constraints set by firms. We develop a model in which firms post job offers characterized by an hours requirement and workers pay search costs to find jobs. We present evidence supporting three predictions of this model by analyzing bunching at kinks using Danish tax records. First, larger kinks generate larger taxable income elasticities. Second, kinks that apply to a larger group of workers generate larger elasticities. Third, the distribution of job offers is tailored to match workers' aggregate tax preferences in equilibrium. Our results suggest that macro elasticities may be substantially larger than the estimates obtained using standard microeconometric methods.},

abstract = {T he canonical model for studying the impact of immigration is a partial equi-librium model that combines one or various types of labor with capital in a constant-returns-to-scale production function (for an early example, see Altonji and Card 1991). The implications of this model for how immigration affects wages and employment are straightforward and intuitive. An expansion of a certain type of labor will lead to a decrease in the wage of native labor of the same type, in absolute terms and relative to other types of labor—as well as an increase in the marginal productivity of capital. This model has led to the common view of immigra-tion being potentially harmful for individuals whose skills are most similar to those of immigrants, but possibly beneficial for those whose skills are different. However, when this canonical model is implemented through empirical models, some studies using this approach find a sizeable effect of immigration on wages of native workers, while others do not. For instance, while Card (2009) finds that immigration to the United States has only a minor effect on native wages, Borjas (2003) provides evidence for wages of natives being harmed by immigration, and Ottaviani and Peri (2012) report positive wage effects on natives. One reaction to these apparently contradictory find-ings has been to expand the theoretical framework in various ways. For example, one},

In Mexican textile/apparel exports to the US, both exporters and importers concentrate more than 80% of product-level trade with the single largest partners (the main partners). To understand how firms choose the main partners and change them in response to liberalization, our model introduces one-to-one matching of exporters and im- porters based on the complementarity/substitutability of firm capability (productivity/quality) within matches in an otherwise standard heterogeneous firm trade model. Our data shows increases in Chi- nese exporters to the US at the end of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement in 2005 caused Mexican exporters to downgrade and US importers to upgrade their main partners. Our model shows this pattern is con- sistent with complementary-driven positive assortative matching, but not with capability-independent random matching or substitutability-driven negative assortative matching. The presence of comple- mentarity we find suggests trade liberalization improves matching of firms in supply chains as a part of within industry reallocation that improves the aggregate industrial performance.},

In these Indian data, the calories necessary for a day's activity cost less than 5 percent of the daily wage, which makes it implausible that income is constrained by nutrition rather than the other way around.},

Probabilistic forecasting aims to maximize the sharpness of the predictive distributions, subject to calibra- tion, on the basis of the available information set. We formalize and study notions of calibration in a prediction space setting. In practice, probabilis- tic calibration can be checked by examining probability integral transform (PIT) histograms. Proper scoring rules such as the logarithmic score and the continuous ranked probability score serve to assess calibration and sharp- ness simultaneously. As a special case, consistent scoring functions provide decision-theoretically coherent tools for evaluating point forecasts.We em- phasizemethodological links to parametric and nonparametric distributional regression techniques, which attempt to model and to estimate conditional distribution functions; we use the context of statistically postprocessed en- semble forecasts in numerical weather prediction as an example. Through- out, we illustrate concepts and methodologies in data examples. 125},

To study these effects, we construct a general equilibrium model of the US economy and calibrate it using data from 1994 to 2001. Built into the model are positive effects high skilled immigrants have on innovation. Counterfactual simulations based on our model suggest that immigration increased the overall welfare of US natives, and had significant distributional consequences. In the absence of immigration, wages for US computer sci-entists would have been 2.6% to 5.1% higher and employment in computer science for US workers would have been 6.1% to 10.8% higher in 2001. On the other hand, complements in production benefited substantially from immigration, and immigration also lowered prices and raised the output of IT goods by between 1.9% and 2.5%, thus benefiting consumers. Finally, firms in the IT sector also earned substantially higher profits due to immigration.},

Over the past decade, mobile money has become a ubiquitous tool in some developing economies, allowing individuals to digitally transact money without formal bank accounts.

However, adoption still lags in many economies and, even where there is universal adoption, product innovation over the rails of these digital accounts has been slow. The review concludes by discussing what the future of mobile money in developing economies may look like and, thus, where the most exciting opportunities for research may be.},

abstract = {In this paper we review important aspects of semiparametric theory and empirical processes that arise in causal inference problems. We begin with a brief introduction to the general problem of causal inference, and go on to discuss estimation and inference for causal effects under semiparametric models, which allow parts of the data-generating process to be unrestricted if they are not of particular interest (i.e., nuisance functions). These models are very useful in causal problems because the outcome process is often complex and difficult to model, and there may only be information available about the treatment process (at best). Semiparametric theory gives a framework for benchmarking efficiency and constructing estimators in such settings. In the second part of the paper we discuss empirical process theory, which provides powerful tools for understanding the asymptotic behavior of semiparametric estimators that depend on flexible nonparametric estimators of nuisance functions. These tools are crucial for incorporating machine learning and other modern methods into causal inference analyses. We conclude by examining related extensions and future directions for work in semiparametric causal inference.},

Or do the societies that are poor today hold certain cultural views that lead to gender inequality? This article discusses several mechanisms through which, as countries grow, gender gaps narrow. I argue that while much of the GDP/gender-inequality relationship can be explained by the process of development, society-specific factors are also at play: Many countries that are poor today have cultural norms that exacerbate favoritism toward males. Norms such as patrilocality and concern for women's "purity" help explain the male-skewed sex ratio in India and China and low female employment in India, the Middle East, and North Africa, for example. I also discuss why the sex ratio has become more male-skewed with development. Finally, I lay out some policy approaches to address gender inequality},

abstract = {In this paper, we formulate a model of early childhood development in which mothers have subjective expectations about the technology of skill formation. The model is useful for understanding how maternal knowledge about child development affects the maternal choices of investments in the human capital of children. Unfortunately, the model is not identified from data that are usually available to econometricians. To solve this problem, we conduct a study where mothers were interviewed to elicit maternal expectations about the technology of skill formation. We interviewed a sample of socioeconomically disadvantaged African‐American women. We find that the median subjective expectation about the elasticity of child development with respect to investments is between 4% and 19%. In comparison, when we estimate the technology of skill formation from the CNLSY/79 data, we find that the elasticity is between 18% and 26%. We use the model and our unique data to answer a simple but important question: What would happen to investments and child development if we implemented a policy that moved expectations from the median to the objective estimates that we obtain from the CNLSY/79 data? According to our estimates, maternal investments would go up by between 4% and 24% and the stocks of cognitive skills at age 24 months would subsequently increase between 1% and 5%. Needless to say, the impacts of such a policy would be even higher for mothers whose expectations were below the median.},

abstract = {One of the main objectives of empirical analysis of experiments and quasi-experiments is to inform policy decisions that determine how treatments are allocated to individuals with different observable covariates. We propose the Empirical Welfare Maximization (EWM) method, which estimates a treatment assignment policy by maximizing the sample analog of average social welfare over a class of candidate treatment policies. We show that, when propensity score is known, the average social welfare attained by EWM rules converges at least at n^{-1/2} rate to the maximum obtainable welfare. This holds uniformly over a minimally constrained class of data distributions, and this uniform convergence rate is minimax optimal. In comparison with this benchmark rate, we examine how the uniform convergence rate of the average welfare improves or deteriorates depending on the richness of the class of candidate decision rules, on the distribution of conditional treatment effects, on the lack of knowledge for the propensity score, and on additional smoothness assumptions for the regression functions or propensity scores. We also discuss practically implementable computation for the EWM rule. As an empirical application, we derive an EWM rule for the a training program using the experiment data analyzed in La Londe (1986).},

abstract = {This paper develops a new distribution theory and inference methods for over-identified Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation focusing on the iterated GMM estimator, allowing for moment misspecification, and for clustered dependence with heterogeneous and growing cluster sizes. This paper is the first to provide a rigorous theory for the iterated GMM estimator. We provide conditions for its existence by demonstrating that the iteration sequence is a contraction mapping. Our asymptotic theory allows the moments to be possibly misspecified, which is a general feature of approximate over-identified models. This form of moment misspecification causes bias in conventional standard error estimation. Our results show how to correct for this standard error bias. Our paper is also the first to provide a rigorous distribution theory for the GMM estimator under cluster dependence. Our distribution theory is asymptotic, and allows for heterogeneous and growing cluster sizes. Our results cover standard smooth moment condition models, including dynamic panels, which is a common application for GMM with cluster dependence. Our simulation results show that conventional heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors are highly biased under moment misspecification, severely understating estimation uncertainty, and resulting in severely over-sized hypothesis tests. In contrast, our misspecification-robust standard errors are approximately unbiased and properly sized under both correct specification and misspecification. We illustrate the method by extending the empirical work reported in Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson, and Yared (2008, American Economic Review) and Cervellati, Jung, Sunde, and Vischer (2014, American Economic Review). Our results reveal an enormous effect of iterating the GMM estimator, demonstrating the arbitrari- ness of using one-step and two-step estimators. Our results also show a large effect of using misspecification robust standard errors instead of the Arellano-Bond standard errors. Our results support Acemoglu, Johnson, Robinson, and Yared's conclusion of an insignificant effect of income on democracy, but reveal that the heterogeneous effects documented by Cervellati, Jung, Sunde, and Vischer are less statistically significant than previously claimed. },

Community motivation alone did not increase hygienic latrine ownership (+1.6 percentage points, P = 0.43), nor did the supply-side intervention (+0.3 percentage points, P = 0.90). Subsidies to the majority of the landless poor increased ownership among subsidized households (+22.0 percentage points, P < 0.001) and their unsubsidized neighbors (+8.5 percentage points, P = 0.001), which suggests that investment decisions are interlinked across neighbors. Subsidies also reduced open defecation by 14 percentage points (P < 0.001).},

abstract = {Encoder-decoder networks are state-of-the-art approaches to biomedical image segmentation, but have two problems: i.e., the widely used pooling operations may discard spatial information, and therefore low-level semantics are lost. Feature fusion methods can mitigate these problems but feature maps of different scales cannot be easily fused because down- and upsampling change the spatial resolution of feature map. To address these issues, we propose INet, which enlarges receptive fields by increasing the kernel sizes of convolutional layers in steps (e.g., from 3times 3 to 7times 7 and then 15times 15 ) instead of downsampling. Inspired by an Inception module, INet extracts features by kernels of different sizes through concatenating the output feature maps of all preceding convolutional layers. We also find that the large kernel makes the network feasible for biomedical image segmentation. In addition, INet uses two overlapping max-poolings, i.e., max-poolings with stride 1, to extract the sharpest features. Fixed-size and fixed-channel feature maps enable INet to concatenate feature maps and add multiple shortcuts across layers. In this way, INet can recover low-level semantics by concatenating the feature maps of all preceding layers and expedite the training by adding multiple shortcuts. Because INet has additional residual shortcuts, we compare INet with a UNet system that also has residual shortcuts (ResUNet). To confirm INet as a backbone architecture for biomedical image segmentation, we implement dense connections on INet (called DenseINet) and compare it to a DenseUNet system with residual shortcuts (ResDenseUNet). INet and DenseINet require 16.9% and 37.6% fewer parameters than ResUNet and ResDenseUNet, respectively. In comparison with six encoder-decoder approaches using nine public datasets, INet and DenseINet demonstrate efficient improvements in biomedical image segmentation. INet outperforms DeepLabV3, which implementing atrous convolution instead of downsampling to increase receptive fields. INet also outperforms two recent methods (named HRNet and MS-NAS) that maintain high-resolution representations and repeatedly exchange the information across resolutions.},

abstract = {The investment decisions of small-scale farmers in developing countries are conditioned by their financial environment. Binding credit market constraints and incomplete insurance can limit investment in activities with high expected profits. We conducted several experiments in northern Ghana in which farmers were randomly assigned to receive cash grants, grants of or opportunities to purchase rainfall index insurance, or a combination of the two. Demand for index insurance is strong, and insurance leads to significantly larger agricultural investment and riskier production choices in agriculture. The binding constraint to farmer investment is uninsured risk: when provided with insurance against the primary catastrophic risk they face, farmers are able to find resources to increase expenditure on their farms. Demand for insurance in subsequent years is strongly increasing with the farmer's own receipt of insurance payouts, with the receipt of payouts by others in the farmer's social network and with recent poor rain in the village. Both investment patterns and the demand for index insurance are consistent with the presence of important basis risk associated with the index insurance, imperfect trust that promised payouts will be delivered and overweighting recent events.},

abstract = {This paper formulates and estimates multistage production functions for child cognitive and noncognitive skills. Output is determined by parental environments and investments at different stages of childhood. We estimate the elasticity of substitution between investments in one period and stocks of skills in that period to assess the benefits of early investment in children compared to later remediation. We establish nonparametric identification of a general class of nonlinear factor models. A by-product of our approach is a framework for evaluating childhood interventions that does not rely on arbitrarily scaled test scores as outputs and recognizes the differential effects of skills in different tasks. Using the estimated technology, we determine optimal targeting of interventions to children with different parental and personal birth endowments. Substitutability decreases in later stages of the life cycle for the production of cognitive skills. It increases in later stages of the life cycle for the production of noncognitive skills. This finding has important implications for the design of policies that target the disadvantaged. For some configurations of disadvantage and outcomes, it is optimal to invest relatively more in the later stages of childhood.},

Estimates of moral hazard in health insurance markets can be con-founded by adverse selection. This paper considers a plausibly exog-enous source of variation in insurance coverage for childbirth in California. We find that additional health insurance coverage induces substantial extensions in length of hospital stay for mother and new-born. However, remaining in the hospital longer has no effect on readmissions or mortality, and the estimates are precise. Our results suggest that for uncomplicated births, minimum insurance mandates incur substantial costs without detectable health benefits. {JEL D82, G22,I12,I18,J13)}},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

This paper combines a rich collection of Mexican microdata with a quantitative spatial equilibrium model and a new empirical strategy to study the long-term economic consequences of tourism both locally and in the aggregate. We find that tourism causes large and significant local economic gains relative to less touristic regions that are in part driven by significant positive spillovers on manufacturing. In the aggregate, however, these local spillovers are largely offset by reductions in agglomeration economies among less touristic regions, so that the national gains from trade in tourism are mainly driven by a classical market integration effect.},

abstract = {Background: Community-led total sanitation (CLTS) uses participatory approaches to mobilise communities to build their own toilets and stop open defecation. Our aim was to undertake the first randomised trial of CLTS to assess its effect on child health in Koulikoro, Mali. Methods: We did a cluster-randomised trial to assess a CLTS programme implemented by the Government of Mali. The study population included households in rural villages (clusters) from the Koulikoro district of Mali; every household had to have at least one child aged younger than 10 years. Villages were randomly assigned (1:1) with a computer-generated sequence by a study investigator to receive CLTS or no programme. Health outcomes included diarrhoea (primary outcome), height for age, weight for age, stunting, and underweight. Outcomes were measured 1{\textperiodcentered}5 years after intervention delivery (2 years after enrolment) among children younger than 5 years. Participants were not masked to intervention assignment. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01900912. Findings: We recruited participants between April 12, and June 23, 2011. We assigned 60 villages (2365 households) to receive the CLTS intervention and 61 villages (2167 households) to the control group. No differences were observed in terms of diarrhoeal prevalence among children in CLTS and control villages (706 [22%] of 3140 CLTS children vs 693 [24%] of 2872 control children; prevalence ratio [PR] 0{\textperiodcentered}93, 95% CI 0{\textperiodcentered}76-1{\textperiodcentered}14). Access to private latrines was almost twice as high in intervention villages (1373 [65%] of 2120 vs 661 [35%] of 1911 households) and reported open defecation was reduced in female (198 [9%] of 2086 vs 608 [33%] of 1869 households) and in male (195 [10%] of 2004 vs 602 [33%] of 1813 households) adults. Children in CLTS villages were taller (0{\textperiodcentered}18 increase in height-for-age Z score, 95% CI 0{\textperiodcentered}03-0{\textperiodcentered}32; 2415 children) and less likely to be stunted (35% vs 41%, PR 0{\textperiodcentered}86, 95% CI 0{\textperiodcentered}74-1{\textperiodcentered}0) than children in control villages. 22% of children were underweight in CLTS compared with 26% in control villages (PR 0{\textperiodcentered}88, 95% CI 0{\textperiodcentered}71-1{\textperiodcentered}08), and the difference in mean weight-for-age Z score was 0{\textperiodcentered}09 (95% CI -0{\textperiodcentered}04 to 0{\textperiodcentered}22) between groups. In CLTS villages, younger children at enrolment (<2 years) showed greater improvements in height and weight than older children. Interpretation: In villages that received a behavioural sanitation intervention with no monetary subsidies, diarrhoeal prevalence remained similar to control villages. However, access to toilets substantially increased and child growth improved, particularly in children <2 years. CLTS might have prevented growth faltering through pathways other than reducing diarrhoea. Funding: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.},

@article{Athey2015,
abstract = {In this paper we study the problems of estimating heterogeneity in causal effects in experimental or observational studies and conducting inference about the magnitude of the differences in treatment effects across subsets of the population. In applications, our method provides a data-driven approach to determine which subpopulations have large or small treatment effects and to test hypotheses about the differences in these effects. For experiments, our method allows researchers to identify heterogeneity in treatment effects that was not specified in a pre-analysis plan, without concern about invalidating inference due to multiple testing. In most of the literature on supervised machine learning (e.g. regression trees, random forests, LASSO, etc.), the goal is to build a model of the relationship between a unit's attributes and an observed outcome. A prominent role in these methods is played by cross-validation which compares predictions to actual outcomes in test samples, in order to select the level of complexity of the model that provides the best predictive power. Our method is closely related, but it differs in that it is tailored for predicting causal effects of a treatment rather than a unit's outcome. The challenge is that the "ground truth" for a causal effect is not observed for any individual unit: we observe the unit with the treatment, or without the treatment, but not both at the same time. Thus, it is not obvious how to use cross-validation to determine whether a causal effect has been accurately predicted. We propose several novel cross-validation criteria for this problem and demonstrate through simulations the conditions under which they perform better than standard methods for the problem of causal effects. We then apply the method to a large-scale field experiment re-ranking results on a search engine.},

abstract = {In Imbens and Ingrist (1994), Angrist, Imbens and Rubin (1996) and Imbens and Rubin (1997), assumptions have been outlined under which instrumental variables estimands can be given a causal interpretation as a local average treatment effect without requiring functional form or constant treatment effect assumptions. We extend these results by showing that under these assumptions one can estimate more from the data than the average causal effect for the subpopulation of compliers; one can, in principle, estimate the entire marginal distribution of the outcome under different treatments for this subpopulation. These distributions might be useful for a policy maker who wishes to take into account not only differences in average of earnings when contemplating the merits of one job training programme vs. another. We also show that the standard instrumental variables estimator implicitly estimates these underlying outcome distributions without imposing the required non-negativity on these implicit density estimates, and that imposing non-negativity can substantially alter the estimates of the local average treatment effect. We illustrate these points by presenting an analysis of the returns to a high school education using quarter of birth as an instrument. We show that the standard instrumental variables estimates implicitly estimate the outcome distributions to be negative over a substantial range, and that the estimates of the local average treatment effect change considerably when we impose nonnegativity in any of a variety of ways.},

abstract = {We study how growth of cities determines the growth of nations. Using a spatial equilibrium model and data on 220 US metropolitan areas from 1964 to 2009, we first estimate the contribution of each U.S. city to national GDP growth. We show that the contribution of a city to aggregate growth can differ significantly from what one might naively infer from the growth of the city's GDP. Despite some of the strongest rate of local growth, New York, San Francisco and San Jose were only responsible for a small fraction of U.S. growth in this period. By contrast, almost half of aggregate US growth was driven by growth of cities in the South. We then provide a normative analysis of potential growth. We show that the dispersion of the conditional average nominal wage across US cities doubled, indicating that worker productivity is increasingly different across cities. We calculate that this increased wage dispersion lowered aggregate U.S. GDP by 13.5%. Most of the loss was likely caused by increased constraints to housing supply in high productivity cities like New York, San Francisco and San Jose. Lowering regulatory constraints in these cities to the level of the median city would expand their work force and increase U.S. GDP by 9.5%. We conclude that the aggregate gains in output and welfare from spatial reallocation of labor are likely to be substantial in the U.S., and that a major impediment to a more efficient spatial allocation of labor are housing supply constraints. These constraints limit the number of US workers who have access to the most productive of American cities. In general equilibrium, this lowers income and welfare of all US workers.},

abstract = {a b S t r aC t Rental housing in India has witnessed a significant decline over the years. This could be attributed to various reasons including the nature of the rent control laws. The rent control law in Mumbai has created a shortfall in formal, affordable rental housing and, at a broader level, has contributed to the distortions in the land market. The nature of the 'first generation' rent control in Mumbai is such that it has led to the deterioration of the existing rental housing stock and virtually halted the construction of new housing for rental for the city. It has also given rise to informal practices such as 'pagdi' or key money. This paper assesses the impact of rent control for Mumbai. In particular, it analyzes the spatial concentration and composition of rent controlled tenements in the city. It then proposes reforms that would allow a gradual move towards rationalized rent controls. It argues that second generation controls will help incentivize investments in the rental housing segment and hence reduce the demand pressure on the housing market at large, with implications for prices and affordable housing in particular.},

This paper gives identification and estimation results for nonparametric conditional moment restrictions. We characterize identification of structural functions as completeness of certain conditional distributions, and give sufficient identification conditions for exponential families and discrete variables. We also give a consistent, nonparametric estimator of the structural function. The estimator is nonparametric two-stage least squares based on series approximation, which overcomes an ill-posed inverse problem by placing bounds on integrals of higher-order derivatives.

The current Great Recession which officially started in December 2007 and ended in June 2009 (National Bureau of Economic Research, 2010) further intensified the debate on immigration. It is important to understand how immigrants fared through this economic downturn and their evolving employment patterns within a diversity of metropolitan areas. Using American Community Survey (ACS) data for 2007 and 2009, this paper traces the employment outcomes of immigrants compared to nativeborn workers before and after the recession across the 100 largest metropolitan areas. Distinctions are made between Asian immigrants and Latino immigrants. Regression analysis further tests the effect of individual human capital characteristics and metropolitan economic, demographic, and policy contexts on immigrant's likelihood of securing employment during this time period.},

abstract = {This paper discusses why, in a medical context, the standard assumption of a risk-neutral social planner is inappropriate and develops a framework for conducting cost-effectiveness (CE) analysis when social planners are risk-averse. This framework demonstrates that if new medical interventions are variance increasing (decreasing), the risk-neutral approach will approve (reject) projects that should be rejected (accepted). This methodology is applied to two medical interventions that have been previously evaluated and considered cost-effective in the published literature. Since both conclusions assumed risk neutrality we determine the level of societal risk-aversion that would be necessary to reject these new interventions and compare these levels to previous estimates of risk-aversion in the economics literature. We find that for reasonable values of the risk-aversion parameter, only one of the two interventions should be approved. It is our recommendation that the cut-off risk aversion parameter (the level of risk-aversion above which a project would be rejected) should become a standard reported figure in future CE studies.},

To answer this question, we use the 14-year nationwide rollout of Mexico's land certification program (Procede) and match affected communities (ejidos) before and after the change in property rights with voting outcomes in corresponding electoral sections across six federal election cycles. We find that, in accordance with the investor class theory, granting complete property rights induced a conservative shift toward the pro-market party equal to 6.8. percent of its average share of votes over the period. This shift was strongest where vested interests created larger expected benefits from market-oriented policies as opposed to public-transfer policies. We also find that beneficiaries failed to reciprocate through votes for the benefactor party. We conclude that, in the Mexican experience, engaging in a land reform that strengthened individual property rights over agricultural land was politically advantageous for the right-wing party. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {To identify communication externalities in French cities, we exploit a unique survey recording workplace communication of individual workers. Our hypothesis is that in larger and/or more educated cities, workers should communicate more. In turn, more communication should have a positive effect on wages. By estimating both an earnings and a communication equation, we find evidence of communication externalities. In larger and more educated cities, workers communicate more and in turn this has a positive effect on their wages. Depending on the estimates, we find that 13 to 22% of the effects of a more educated and larger city on wages percolate through this channel. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Our model extends previous empirical work on wage equations by introducing determinants of aggregate market demand and supply into an explicit, economically interpretable estimating equation. These extensions are required to produce a model that fits the distribution of wages for the U.S. labor market.},

In the cross-section, multiproduct firms in India look remarkably similar to their U.S. counterparts. The time-series patterns, however, exhibit important differences. In contrast to evidence from the United States, product churning, particularly product rationalization, is far less common in India. We find no link between product rationalization and output tariff declines following India's 1991 trade liberalization. The lack of “creative destruction” is consistent with the role of industrial regulation in preventing an efficient allocation of resources.},

abstract = {The farm household model has played a central role in improving the understanding of small-scale agricultural households and non-farm enterprises. Under the assump-tions that all current and future markets exist and that farmers treat all prices as given, the model simplifies households' simultaneous production and consumption decisions into a recursive form in which production can be treated as independent of preferences of household members. These assumptions, which are the foundation of a large litera-ture in labor and development, have been tested and not rejected in several important studies including Benjamin (1992). Using multiple waves of longitudinal survey data from Central Java, Indonesia, this paper tests a key prediction of the recursive model: demand for farm labor is unrelated to the demographic composition of the farm house-hold. The prediction is unambiguously rejected. The rejection cannot be explained by contamination due to unobserved heterogeneity that is fixed at the farm level, local area shocks, or farm-specific shocks that affect changes in household composition and farm labor demand. We conclude that the recursive form of the farm household model is not consistent with the data. Developing empirically tractable models of farm households when markets are incomplete remains an important challenge.},

In both the experimental and non-experimental data, we found that teacher effects faded out by roughly 50 percent per year in the two years following teacher assignment.},

The programme randomised transfers at the municipality level to either household heads (generally a male) or mothers. We show that women who were offered the transfer on average have stronger measured empowerment. Here, IV estimation confirms this result.},

abstract = {We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSRVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 different classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0% which is considerably better than the previous state of the art. The neural network, which has 60 million paramters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolutional operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers, we employed a recently-developed method called 'dropout' that proved to be effective. We also entered a variant of the model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achievd a top-5 test error rate of 15.3%, compared to 26.2% achieved by the second-best entry.},

abstract = {Reallocation growth occurs when an input moves from a lower marginal product to a higher marginal product activity. Three recent studies use two distinct methodologies to examine the sources of the strong surge in aggregate productivity growth (APG) in India�s manufacturing sector since 1990 following significant economic reforms. They all conclude that APG was primarily driven by within-plant increases in technical efficiency and not between-plant reallocation of inputs. Given the nature of the reforms, where many barriers to input reallocation were removed, this finding has surprised researchers and been dubbed �India�s Mysterious Manufacturing Miracle.� In this paper we show that these findings may be an artifact of the way the studies estimate reallocation. One approach counts all reallocation growth arising from the movement of intermediate inputs as technical efficiency growth. The second approach introduces measurement error into estimated reallocation by using plant-level average products - total factor productivity residuals - as a proxy for marginal products, which could be problematic as economic theory suggests that average products and marginal products are unrelated in equilibrium. Using microdata on manufacturing from 4 countries � the U.S., Chile, Colombia, and Slovenia � we show that both approaches significantly understate the true role of reallocation in economic growth. In the U.S. almost 50% of reallocation growth is due to movements of intermediate inputs, meaning if India is similar to the U.S. then reallocation�s share of total Indian manufacturing APG since 1990 increases from the previous estimate of one-third to almost two-thirds.},

abstract = {There is very limited experimental evidence of the impact of large-scale, government-led school meals programs on child educational achievements in Sub-Saharan Africa. We address this gap by reporting treatment effects from a nationwide randomized trial of the Government of Ghana's school feeding program (GSFP) on children's math and literacy, cognition (problem-solving ability and working memory), and composite scores of overall attainments. Based on the government's plans to re-target and scale up the GSFP, food insecure schools and related communities across the country were randomly assigned to school feeding. After two years of implementation, program availability led to moderate increases in test scores for the average pupil in school catchment areas, ranging between 0.12 and 0.16 standard deviations. Analysis focusing on per-protocol population subgroups unveiled substantial heterogeneity: school feeding led to remarkable learning and cognitive gains for girls, poorest children, and children from the northern regions. Program effects were at least twice as large as for the average child. Increases in enrolment, grade attainment, and shifts in time use toward schooling time constituted potential mechanisms for impact. We conclude the program combined social protection with equitable human capital accumulation, thus contributing to the imperative of “learning for all” set in the Sustainable Development Goals.},

abstract = {The textbook policy response to traffic externalities is congestion pricing. However, quanti-fying the welfare consequences of pricing policies requires detailed knowledge of commuter pref-erences and of the road technology. I study the peak-hour traffic congestion equilibrium using rich travel behavior data and a field experiment grounded in theory. Using a newly developed smartphone app, I collected a panel data set with precise GPS coordinates for over 100,000 com-muter trips in Bangalore, India. To identify the key preference parameters in my model – the value of time spent driving and schedule flexibility – I designed and implemented a randomized experiment with two realistic congestion charge policies. The policies penalize peak-hour depar-ture times and driving through a small charged area, respectively. Structural estimates based on the experiment show that commuters exhibit moderate schedule flexibility and high value of time. In a separate analysis of the road technology, I find a moderate and linear effect of traffic volume on travel time. I combine the preference parameters and road technology using policy simulations of the equilibrium optimal congestion charge, which reveal notable travel time bene-fits, yet negligible welfare gains. Intuitively, the social value of the travel time saved by removing commuters from the peak-hour is not significantly larger than the costs to those commuters of traveling at different, inconvenient times. * I am deeply grateful to my advisers Ben Olken, Esther Duflo, Frank Schilbach, and Edward Glaeser for their advice and generous support throughout this project.

abstract = {We propose strategies to estimate and make inference on key features of heterogeneous effects in randomized experiments. These key features include best linear predictors of the effects using machine learning proxies, average effects sorted by impact groups, and average characteristics of most and least impacted units. The approach is valid in high dimensional settings, where the effects are proxied by machine learning methods. We post-process these proxies into the estimates of the key features. Our approach is generic, it can be used in conjunction with penalized methods, deep and shallow neural networks, canonical and new random forests, boosted trees, and ensemble methods. Our approach is agnostic and does not make unrealistic or hard-to-check assumptions; we don't require conditions for consistency of the ML methods. Estimation and inference relies on repeated data splitting to avoid overfitting and achieve validity. For inference, we take medians of p-values and medians of confidence intervals, resulting from many different data splits, and then adjust their nominal level to guarantee uniform validity. This variational inference method is shown to be uniformly valid and quantifies the uncertainty coming from both parameter estimation and data splitting. The inference method could be of substantial independent interest in many machine learning applications. An empirical application to the impact of micro-credit on economic development illustrates the use of the approach in randomized experiments. An additional application to the impact of the gender discrimination on wages illustrates the potential use of the approach in observational studies, where machine learning methods can be used to condition flexibly on very high-dimensional controls.},

abstract = {We present current methods for estimating treatment effects and spillover effects under "interference", a term which covers a broad class of situations in which a unit's outcome depends not only on treatments received by that unit, but also on treatments received by other units. To the extent that units react to each other, interact, or otherwise transmit effects of treatments, valid inference requires that we account for such interference, which is a departure from the traditional assumption that units' outcomes are affected only by their own treatment assignment. Interference and associated spillovers may be a nuisance or they may be of substantive interest to the researcher. In this chapter, we focus on interference in the context of randomized experiments. We review methods for when interference happens in a general network setting. We then consider the special case where interference is contained within a hierarchical structure. Finally, we discuss the relationship between interference and contagion. We use the interference R package and simulated data to illustrate key points. We consider efficient designs that allow for estimation of the treatment and spillover effects and discuss recent empirical studies that try to capture such effects.},

First, researchers have used observational data from a represen-tative sample of eligible individuals, i , some of whom self-selected into the program, to estimate the effect of program participation, T , using the following regression: (1) Y ij = $\mu$ j + $\beta$ j T ij + $\eta$ ij . The OLS estimates of $\beta$ j clearly suffer poten-tial bias. Second, the policymaker reviews avail-able experimental studies of similar programs in other contexts ($\beta$ k for k ≠ j) that use random assignment to overcome this bias. This is a stylized description of many real-world decisions, in which policymakers must weigh observational data from the right context against experimental evidence from a differ-ent program and context. This paper attempts to measure the trade-off between internal and external validity empirically, using examples from development economics. The root mean squared error (RMSE) of the prediction of program impact encompasses threats to both internal and external validity. We calculate the RMSE for observational estimates from the relevant context by comparing it to the experimental estimate from within the same study: (2) RMSE ($\beta$ ̂ j},

abstract = {We consider a model of technological learning under which people ‘‘learn through noticing'': they choose which input dimensions to attend to and subse- quently learn about from available data. Using this model, we show how people with a great deal of experience may persistently be off the production frontier because they fail to notice important features of the data they possess. We also develop predictions on when these learning failures are likely to occur, as well as on the types of interventions that can help people learn. We test the model's predictions in a field experiment with seaweed farmers. The survey data reveal that these farmers do not attend to pod size, a particular input dimension. Experimental trials suggest that farmers are particularly far from optimizing this dimension. Furthermore, consistent with the model, we find that simply having access to the experimental data does not induce learning. Instead, be- havioral changes occur only after the farmers are presented with summaries that highlight previously unattended-to relationships in the data. JEL Codes: D03, D83, O13, O14, O30, Q16.

abstract = {To study the impact of the choice of injection points in the diffusion of a new product in a society, we developed a model of word-of-mouth diffusion and then applied it to data on social networks and participation in a newly available microfinance loan program in 43 Indian villages. Our model allows us to distinguish information passing among neighbors from direct influence of neighbors' participation decisions, as well as information passing by participants versus nonparticipants. The model estimates suggest that participants are seven times as likely to pass information compared to informed nonparticipants, but information passed by nonparticipants still accounts for roughly one-third of eventual participation. An informed household is not more likely to participate if its informed friends participate. We then propose two new measures of how effective a given household would be as an injection point. We show that the centrality of the injection points according to these measures constitutes a strong and significant predictor of eventual village-level participation.},

abstract = {Understanding potential spillovers from the attributes and actions of neighborhood residents onto the value of surrounding properties and neighborhoods is central to both the theory of urban economics and the development of efficient housing policy. This paper measures the capitalization of housing market spillovers by studying the sudden and largely unanticipated 1995 elimination of stringent rent controls in Cambridge, Massachusetts that had previously muted landlords' investment incentives and altered the assignment of residents to locations. Pooling administrative data on the assessed values of each residential property and the prices and characteristics of all residential transactions between 1988 and 2005, we find that rent control's removal produced large, positive, and robust spillovers onto the price of never-controlled housing from nearby decontrolled units. Elimination of rent control added about 1.8 billion to the value of Cambridge's housing stock between 1994 and 2004, equal to nearly a quarter of total Cambridge residential price appreciation in this period. Positive spillovers to never-controlled properties account for more half of the induced price appreciation. Residential investments can explain only a small fraction of the total.},

Following the literature on local maximum likelihood estimation, our method considers a weighted set of nearby training examples; however, instead of using classical kernel weighting functions that are prone to a strong curse of dimensionality, we use an adaptive weighting function derived from a forest designed to express heterogeneity in the specified quantity of interest. We propose a flexible, computationally efficient algorithm for growing generalized random forests, develop a large sample theory for our method showing that our estimates are consistent and asymptotically Gaussian, and provide an estimator for their asymptotic variance that enables valid confidence intervals. We use our approach to develop new methods for three statistical tasks: non-parametric quantile regression, conditional average partial effect estimation, and heterogeneous treatment effect estimation via instrumental variables. A software implementation, grf for R and C++, is available from CRAN.},

We find that subjective principal assessments of teachers predict future student achievement significantly better than teacher experience, education or actual compensation, though not as well as value-added teacher quality measures. In particular, principals appear quite good at identifying those teachers who produce the largest and smallest standardized achievement gains in their schools, but have far less ability to distinguish between teachers in the middle of this distribution and systematically discriminate against male and untenured faculty. Moreover, we find that a principal's overall rating of a teacher is a substantially better predictor of future parent requests for that teacher than either the teacher's experience, education and current compensation or the teacher's value-added achievement measure. These findings not only inform education policy, but also shed light on subjective performance assessment more generally.},

This exploratory analysis quantifies spatial features of built-up areas derived from high-resolution satellite imagery and directly relates them to census-derived variables in Accra, Ghana. Spatial features are image metrics that analyze pixel groups in order to describe the geometry, orientation, and patterns of objects in an image. By using spatial features in an urban setting, city infrastructure variations, such as roads and buildings, can be quantified and related to census variables, such as living stan- dards and housing conditions. To test the associations between spatial patterns and demographic variables, five spatial features (line support regions, PanTex, histograms of oriented gradients, local binary patterns, and Fourier transform) were quantified and extracted from the imagery, and then correlated to the cen- sus variables. Findings indicate both spatial features and spectral information (such as NDVI) correlate strongly with standards of living such as population and housing density. Results from this study suggest that spatial features derived from satellite imagery can be used to help map socioeconomic characteristics within the city of Accra, Ghana, and that this methodology may be transferable to other developing cities.},

We focus on estimation by local linear regression, which was shown to have attractive properties (Porter, J. 2003, “Estimation in the Regression Discontinuity Model” (unpublished, Department of Economics, University of Wisconsin, Madison)). We derive the asymptotically optimal bandwidth under squared error loss. This optimal bandwidth depends on unknown functionals of the distribution of the data and we propose simple and consistent estimators for these functionals to obtain a fully data-driven bandwidth algorithm. We show that this bandwidth estimator is optimal according to the criterion of Li (1987, “Asymptotic Optimality for Cp, CL, Cross-validation and Generalized Cross-validation: Discrete Index Set”, Annals of Statistics, 15, 958–975), although it is not unique in the sense that alternative consistent estimators for the unknown functionals would lead to bandwidth estimators with the same optimality properties. We illustrate the proposed bandwidth, and the sensitivity to the choices made in our algorithm, by applying the methods to a data set previously analysed by Lee (2008, “Randomized Experiments from Non-random Selection in U.S. House Elections”, Journal of Econometrics, 142, 675–697) as well as by conducting a small simulation study.},

abstract = {We develop new tools for causal inference in settings where exogenous shocks affect the treatment status of multiple observations jointly, to different extents. In these settings researchers may construct treatments or instruments that combine the shocks with predetermined measures of shock exposure. Examples include measures of spillovers in social and transportation networks, simulated eligibility instruments, and shift-share instruments. We show that leveraging the exogeneity of shocks for identification generally requires a simple but nonstandard recentering, derived from the specification of counterfactual shocks that might as well have been realized. We further show how specification of counterfactual shocks can be used for finite-sample inference and specification tests, and we characterize the recentered instruments that are asymptotically efficient. We use this framework to estimate the employment effects of Chinese market access growth due to high-speed rail construction and the insurance coverage effects of expanded Medicaid eligibility.

abstract = {This article introduces a new class of instrumental variable (IV) estimators for linear and nonlinear treatment response models with covariates. The rationale for focusing on nonlinear models is that, if the dependent variable is binary or limited, or if the effect of the treatment varies with covariates, a nonlinear model is appropriate. In the spirit of Roehrig (Econometrica 56 (1988) 433), identification is attained nonparametrically and does not depend on the choice of the parametric specification for the response function of interest. One virtue of this approach is that it allows the researcher to construct estimators that can be interpreted as the parameters of a well-defined approximation to a treatment response function under functional form misspecification. In contrast to some usual IV models, heterogeneity of treatment effects is not restricted by the identification conditions. The ideas and estimators in this article are illustrated using IV to estimate the effects of 401(k) retirement programs on savings. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Poverty traps have captured the interest of many development policy makers, because poverty traps provide a theoretically coherent explanation for persistent poverty. They also suggest that temporary policy interventions may have long-term effects on poverty. However, a review of the reduced-form empirical evidence suggests that truly stagnant incomes of the sort predicted by standard models of poverty traps are in fact quite rare. Moreover, the empirical evidence regarding several canonical mechanisms underlying models of poverty traps is mixed.},

abstract = {Many scientific and engineering challenges---ranging from personalized medicine to customized marketing recommendations---require an understanding of treatment effect heterogeneity. In this paper, we develop a non-parametric causal forest for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects that extends Breiman's widely used random forest algorithm. Given a potential outcomes framework with unconfoundedness, we show that causal forests are pointwise consistent for the true treatment effect, and have an asymptotically Gaussian and centered sampling distribution. We also discuss a practical method for constructing asymptotic confidence intervals for the true treatment effect that are centered at the causal forest estimates. Our theoretical results rely on a generic Gaussian theory for a large family of random forest algorithms that, to our knowledge, is the first set of results that allows any type of random forest, including classification and regression forests, to be used for provably valid statistical inference. In experiments, we find causal forests to be substantially more powerful than classical methods based on nearest-neighbor matching, especially as the number of covariates increases.},

Until recently, the theoretical literature on economic geography had focused on styl-ized settings that could not easily be taken to the data. This paper reviews more recent research that has developed quantitative models of economic geography. These models are rich enough to speak to first-order features of the data, such as many heterogenous locations and gravity equation rela-tionships for trade and commuting. Yet at the same time these models are sufficiently tractable to undertake realistic counterfactuals exercises to study the effect of changes in amenities, productivity, and public policy interventions such as transport infrastructure investments. We provide an extensive taxonomy of the different building blocks of these quantitative spatial models and discuss their main properties and quantification.},

At the national level, social mobility is low and the intergenerational persistence rate is high: 0.62. In terms of absolute upward mobility, those born in households at the 25th percentile reach, on average, the 35th percentile. At the regional level, the estimations show a clear north-south gradient: the children of poor parents show greater upward mobility with increasing distance from the south, the country's poorest region. Notably, the opportunities to move up the social ladder are fewer and less compact than in Canada or the United States: in Mexico, inequality of opportunity by place of birth is greater. The variables most correlated with social mobility at the regional level seem to show an association between lower social mobility and higher inequality of opportunity in human capital accumulation and access to work and income throughout the life cycle.},

abstract = {India's male-biased sex ratio has worsened over the past several decades. In combination with the increased availability of prenatal sex-diagnostic technology, the declining fertility rate is a hypothesized factor. Suppose a couple strongly wants to have at least one son. At the natural sex ratio, they are less likely to have a son the fewer children they have, so a smaller desired family size will increase the likelihood they manipulate the sex composition of their children. This paper empirically measures the relationship between desired fertility and the sex ratio. Standard survey questions on fertility preferences ask the respondent her desired number of children of each sex, but people who want larger families have systematically stronger son preference, which generates bias. This paper instead elicits desired sex composition at specified, randomly determined, levels of total fertility. These data allow one to isolate the causal effect of family size on the desired sex ratio. I find that the desired sex ratio increases sharply as the fertility rate falls; fertility decline can explain roughly half of the increase in the sex ratio that has occurred in India over the past thirty years. In addition, factors such as female education that lead to more progressive attitudes could counterintuitively cause a more male-skewed sex ratio because while they reduce the desired sex ratio at any given family size, they also reduce desired family size.},

If M is a model assuming ignorability, we surround M by a small neighbourhood Ar defined in the sense of Kullback-Leibler divergence and then compare the inference for models in Ar with that for M. Interpretable bounds for such differences are developed. Applications to missing data and to observational comparisons are discussed. Local approximations to sensitivity analysis are model robust and can be applied to a wide range of statistical problems.},

abstract = {High levels of alcohol consumption are more common among the poor. This fact could have economic consequences beyond mere income effects because alcohol impairs mental processes and decision-making. Since alcohol is thought to induce myopia, this paper tests for impacts on self-control and on savings behavior. In a three-week field experiment with low-income workers in India, I provided 229 individuals with a high-return savings opportunity and randomized incentives for sobriety. The incentives significantly reduced daytime drinking as measured by decreased breathalyzer scores. This in turn increased savings by approximately 60 percent. No more than half of this effect is explained by changes in income net of alcohol expenditures. In addition, con-sistent with enhanced self-control due to lower inebriation levels, incentivizing sobriety reduced the impact of a savings commitment device. Finally, alcohol consumption itself is prone to self-control problems: over half of the study participants were willing to sacrifice money to receive incentives to be sober, exhibiting demand for commitment to increase their sobriety. These findings suggest that heavy alcohol consumption is not just a result of self-control problems, but also creates self-control problems in other areas, potentially even exacerbating poverty by reducing savings.},

abstract = {Motivated by recent work on the labor market eects of trade, we build a model of trade with labor market frictions and regulations that are not perfectly enforced by the government. Heterogeneous rms decide whether to operate formally or informally , allowing for a link between globalization, informality and unemployment. We estimate the model using several data sources from Brazil, including matched employer-employee data from formal and informal rms and workers. We perform counterfactual analyses to understand how increasing trade openness aects informality , unemployment and welfare under dierent scenarios of labor market regulations and levels of enforcement. Our results suggest that domestic policies leading to a reduction in informality have the potential to strongly increase aggregate productivity and welfare, at the expense of modest increases in unemployment. These policies have a much larger eect on welfare relative to policies aiming to reduce international trade costs. The informal sector works as a buer in the event of negative economic shocks. However, the welfare gains from eradicating informality are so signicant that it is hard to justify lenience toward the informal sector on the basis that it works as a buer following negative economic shocks.},

Abstract Educational outcomes have many determinants, but one that most young people can readily control is choosing whether to work while in school. Sixty-nine studies have estimated the effect, but results vary from large negative to positive estimates. We show that the results are systematically driven by context, publication bias, and treatment of endogeneity. Studies ignoring endogeneity suffer from an upward bias, which is almost fully compensated by publication selection in favor of negative estimates. Net of the biases, the literature suggests a negative but economically inconsequential mean effect. The effect is more negative for high-intensity employment and educational outcomes measured as decisions to dropout, but it is positive in Germany. To derive these results we collect 861 previously reported estimates together with 32 variables reflecting estimation context, use recently developed nonlinear techniques to correct for publication bias, and employ Bayesian and frequentist model averaging to assign a pattern to the heterogeneity in the literature.},

However, time-preference parameters are typically not identified in standard dynamic choice models and little is known about the fraction of inconsistent agents in the population. We formulate a dynamic discrete choice model in an unobservedly heterogeneous population of possibly time-inconsistent agents motivated by specifically collected information combined with a field intervention in rural India. We identify and estimate all time-preference parameters as well as the population fractions of time-consistent and naive and sophisticated time-inconsistent agents. We estimate that time-inconsistent agents account for more than half of the population and that sophisticated inconsistent agents are considerably more present-biased than their naive counterparts. We also examine whether there are other differences across types (e.g. in risk and cost preferences) and find that these differences are small relative to the differences in time preferences.},

The idea of the approach is that the welfare effect of policy changes can be expressed in terms estimable reduced-form elasticities, allowing for policy evaluation without estimating the structural primitives of fully specified models. The approach relies on three assumptions: that policy changes are small, that government policy is the only source of market imperfection, and that a set of high-level restrictions on the environment and on preferences can be used to reduce the number of elasticities to be estimated. We generalize the approach in all three dimensions. It is possible to develop transparent sufficient statistics formulas under very general conditions, but the estimation requirements increase greatly. Starting from such general formulas elucidates that feasible empirical implementations are in fact structural approaches.},

The test is fully data-driven and employs cross-validated smoothing parameter selection while the null distribution of the test is obtained via bootstrapping. The proposed approach allows applied researchers to test hypotheses concerning categorical variables in a fully nonparametric and robust framework, thereby deflecting potential criticism that a particular finding is driven by an arbitrary parametric specification. Simulations reveal that the test performs well, having significantly better power than a conventional frequency-based nonparametric test. The test is applied to determine whether OECD and non-OECD countries follow the same growth rate model or not. Our test suggests that OECD and non-OECD countries follow different growth rate models, while the tests based on a popular parametric specification and the conventional frequency-based nonparametric estimation method fail to detect any significant difference.},

Specifically, we focus on three aspects. First, we examine the endogeneity of the network or peer groups. Second, we investigate simultaneously alternative definitions of links and the possibility of peer effects arising through multiple networks. Third, we highlight the representation of the traditional linear-in-means model as an autore- gressive model, and contrast it with an alternative moving-average model, where the correlation between unconnected individuals who are indirectly connected is limited. Using data on friendship networks from the Add Health dataset, we illustrate the empirical relevance of these ideas.},

abstract = {Kernel-based estimators such as local polynomial estimators in regression discontinuity designs are often evaluated at multiple bandwidths as a form of sensitivity analysis. However, if in the reported results, a researcher selects the bandwidth based on this analysis, the associated confidence intervals (CIs) may not have correct coverage, even if the estimator is unbiased. This article proposes a simple adjustment that gives correct coverage in such situations: replace the normal quantile with a critical value that depends only on the kernel and ratio of the maximum and minimum bandwidths the researcher has entertained. We tabulate these critical values and quantify the loss in coverage for conventional CIs. For a range of relevant cases, a conventional 95% CI has coverage between 70% and 90%, and our adjustment amounts to replacing the conventional critical value 1.96 with a number between 2.2 and 2.8. Our results also apply to other settings involving trimmed data, such as trimming to ensure overlap in treatment effect estimation. We illustrate our approach with three empirical applications.},

@article{Abadie2017,
abstract = {Many applied settings in empirical economics involve simultaneous estimation of a large number of parameters. In particular, applied economists are often interested in estimating the effects of many-valued treatments (like teacher effects or location effects), treatment effects for many groups, and prediction models with many regressors. In these settings, machine learning methods that combine regularized estimation and data-driven choices of regularization parameters are useful to avoid over-fitting. In this article, we analyze the performance of a class of machine learning estimators that includes ridge, lasso and pretest in contexts that require simultaneous estimation of many parameters. Our analysis aims to provide guidance to applied researchers on (i) the choice between regularized estimators in practice and (ii) data-driven selection of regularization parameters. To address (i), we characterize the risk (mean squared error) of regularized estimators and derive their relative performance as a function of simple features of the data generating process. To address (ii), we show that data-driven choices of regularization parameters, based on Stein's unbiased risk estimate or on cross-validation, yield estimators with risk uniformly close to the risk attained under the optimal (unfeasible) choice of regularization parameters. We use data from recent examples in the empirical economics literature to illustrate the practical applicability of our results.},

@article{Peters2010,
abstract = {Aggregate total factor productivity depends both on firms� physical\nproductivity (technology) and\n\non the efficiency of the resource allocation. The empirical regularity\nthat cross-sectional productivity\n\ndifferences are more pronounced in underdeveloped economies is often\ninterpreted as evidence for the\n\nimportance of misallocation to explain the cross-country variation\nin TFP. This paper argues, that this\n\nfinding is also informative about differences in technology. I construct\na simple endogenous growth\n\nmodel, where the cross-sectional distribution of productivity and\nthe growth rate of aggregate TFP are\n\njointly determined. As output markets are imperfectly competitive,\nthe cross-sectional productivity\n\ndispersion will reflect the distribution of mark-ups. Mark-ups, however,\nnot only cause static misallocation,\n\nbut they also determine innovation and entry incentives and hence\nthe equilibrium growth\n\nrate. If equilibrium entry is intense (for example because entry barriers\nare low), product markets are\n\ncompetitive, the productivity dispersion across firms is small and\nthe aggregate growth rate is high.\n\nThe cross-country variation in productivity dispersion might therefore\nbe a symptom of fundamental\n\ndifferences in the innovation environment. Using firm-level data from\nIndonesia, I present both reduced\n\nform evidence for this mechanism and estimate the models� structural\nparameters. A policy,\n\nwhich reduces existing entry barriers by 10%, will increase welfare\nby 5%. While 10% of these gains are\n\nattributed to a reduction of static misallocation, 60% stem from a\nchange in the equilibrium growth\n\nrate.},

abstract = {This paper assesses when the validity of difference-in-differences and related estimators depends on functional form. We provide a novel characterization: the parallel trends assumption holds under all strictly monotonic transformations of the outcome if and only if a stronger "parallel trends"-type condition holds for the cumulative distribution function of untreated potential outcomes. This condition is satisfied if and essentially only if the population can be partitioned into a subgroup for which treatment is effectively randomly assigned and a remaining subgroup for which the distribution of untreated potential outcomes is stable over time. We show further that it is impossible to construct any estimator that is consistent (or unbiased) for the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT) without either imposing functional form restrictions or imposing assumptions that identify the full distribution of untreated potential outcomes. Our results suggest that researchers who wish to point-identify the ATT should justify one of the following: (i) why treatment is as-if randomly assigned, (ii) why the chosen functional form is correct at the exclusion of others, or (iii) a method for inferring the entire counterfactual distribution of untreated potential outcomes.},

abstract = {Worker industry affiliation plays a crucial role in how trade policy affects wages in many trade models. Yet, most research has focused on how trade policy affects wages by altering the economy-wide returns to a specific worker characteristic (i.e., skill or education) rather than through worker industry affiliation. This paper exploits drastic trade liberalizations in Colombia in the 1980s and 1990s to investigate the relationship between protection and industry wage premiums. We relate wage premiums to trade policy in an empirical framework that accounts for the political economy of trade protection. Accounting for time-invariant political economy factors is critical. When we do not control for unobserved time-invariant industry characteristics, we find that workers in protected sectors earn less than workers with similar observable characteristics in unprotected sectors. Allowing for industry fixed effects reverses the result: trade protection increases relative wages. This positive relationship persists when we instrument for tariff changes. Our results are in line with short- and medium-run models of trade where labor is immobile across sectors or, alternatively, with the existence of industry rents that are reduced by trade liberalization. In the context of the current debate on the rising income inequality in developing countries, our findings point to a source of disparity beyond the well-documented rise in the economy-wide skill premium: because tariff reductions were proportionately larger in sectors employing a high fraction of less-skilled workers, the decrease in the wage premiums in these sectors affected such workers disproportionately. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {What are the long run consequences of planning and providing basic infrastructure in neighborhoods, where people build their own homes? We study "Sites and Services" projects implemented in seven Tanzanian cities during the 1970s and 1980s, half of which provided infrastructure in previously unpopulated areas (de novo neighborhoods), while the other half upgraded squatter settlements. Using satellite images and surveys from the 2010s, we find that de novo neighborhoods developed better housing than adjacent residential areas (control areas) that were also initially unpopulated. Specifically, de novo neighborhood are more orderly and their buildings have larger footprint areas and are more likely to have multiple stories, as well as connections to electricity and water, basic sanitation and access to roads. And though de novo neighborhoods generally attracted better educated residents than control areas, the educational difference is too small to account for the large difference in residential quality that we find. While we have no natural counterfactual for the upgrading areas, descriptive evidence suggests that they are if anything worse than the control areas. Keywords:},

The analysis is based on a general equilibrium model with labor market search frictions, wage bargaining, ﬁring costs, ﬁrm-speciﬁc productivity shocks, and endogenous entry/exit decisions. Firing costs reduce ﬁrms' proﬁts and discourage them from quickly adjusting their employment levels in response to idiosyncratic shocks. Tariﬀs and other trade costs reduce rents for eﬃcient ﬁrms and increase rents for ineﬃcient ﬁrms, as in Melitz (2003). These well-known eﬀects interact with idiosyncratic productivity shocks and with scale economies in hiring costs to determine the equilibrium size distribution of ﬁrms, entry/exit rates, job turnover rates, rate of informality, and cross-ﬁrm wage distributions.},

We show that these standard errors can lead to substantial improvements in coverage rates even for sample sizes of fifty and more. We recommend researchers calculate the Bell-McCaffrey degrees-of-freedom adjustment to assess potential problems with conventional robust standard errors and use the modification as a matter of routine.},

abstract = {In this chapter we analyze the considerations that lead policy makers to undertake extension investments as a key public responsibility, as well as the complex set of factors and intra-agency incentives that explain why different extension systems' performance varies. Accordingly, the chapter provides a conceptual framework outlining farmers' demand for information, the welfare economic characterizations of extension services, and the organizational and political attributes that govern the performance of extension systems. The framework is used to examine several extension modalities and to analyze their likely and actual effectiveness. Specifically, the modalities reviewed include "training and visit" extension, decentralized systems, "fee-for-service" and privatized extension, and farmer-field-schools. The chapter also provides a discussion of methodological issues pertaining to the assessment of extension outcomes, and a review of some of the recent empirical literature on extension impact. The chapter emphasizes the efficiency gains that can come from locally decentralized delivery systems with incentive structures based on largely private provision that in most countries will still be publicly funded. In wealthier countries, and for particular higher income farmer groups, extension systems will likely evolve into fee-for-service organizations. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Multivalued treatment models have typically been studied under restrictive assumptions: ordered choice, and more recently unordered monotonicity. We show how treatment effects can be identified in a more general class of models that allows for multidimensional unobserved heterogeneity. Our results rely on two main assumptions: treatment assignment must be a measurable function of threshold-crossing rules, and enough continuous instruments must be available. We illustrate our approach for several classes of models.

@article{Chay2012,
abstract = {We find that southern blacks responded collectively to political and economic opportunities after Emancipation, but only in places where specific conditions were satisfied. Blacks would have worked (and lived) in close proximity to each other in counties where labor intensive planta- tion crops were grown. Spatial proximity would have resulted in more connected social networks. These connected networks would have supported the formation of larger coalitions of black ac- tivists during Reconstruction and larger coalitions of black workers moving together to northern cities during the Great Migration. Our theory places additional structure on this relationship. Coalitions will not form and there will be no association between network connectedness and the outcomes of interest – political participation and migration – up to a threshold, followed by a positive association above the threshold. Voting and migration patterns across counties are consistent with the theory - there is no association with our crop-based measure of network connectedness up to a threshold point at which a steep, monotonic relationship begins. This finding is robust to rigorous testing, and these tests show that the specific nonlinearity implied by the theory is not obtained for blacks at other points in time, for whites, or for other determi- nants of voting and migration. Blacks from southern counties where labor intensive crops were grown accounted for a disproportionate share of northern migrants, and these migrants appear to have benefited from network externalities, as they moved to the same destination cities.},

@article{Athey2016,
abstract = {There are many studies where researchers are interested in estimating average treatment effects and are willing to rely on the unconfoundedness assumption, which requires that treatment assignment is as good as random conditional on pre-treatment variables. The unconfoundedness assumption is often more plausible if a large number of pre-treatment variables are included in the analysis, but this can worsen the finite sample properties of existing approaches to estimation. In particular, existing methods do not handle well the case where the model for the propensity score (that is, the model relating pre-treatment variables to treatment assignment) is not sparse. In this paper, we propose a new method for estimating average treatment effects in high dimensions that combines balancing weights and regression adjustments. We show that our estimator achieves the semi-parametric efficiency bound for estimating average treatment effects without requiring any modeling assumptions on the propensity score. The result relies on two key assumptions, namely overlap (that is, all units have a propensity score that is bounded away from 0 and 1), and sparsity of the model relating pre-treatment variables to outcomes.},

@book{Freeman2010,
abstract = {This chapter reviews what economists have learned about the impact of labor market institutions, defined broadly as government regulations and union activity on labor outcomes in developing countries. It finds that: (1) Labor institutions vary greatly among developing countries but less than they vary among advanced countries. Unions and collective bargaining are less important in developing than in advanced countries while government regulations are nominally as important. (2) Many developing countries' compliance with minimum wage regulations produces spikes in wage distributions around the minimum in covered sectors. Most studies find modest adverse effects of the minimum on employment so that the minimum raises the total income of lowpaid labor. (3) In many countries minimum wages "spillover" to the unregulated sector, producing spikes in the wage distributions there as well. (4) Employment protection regulations and related laws shift output and employment to informal sectors and reduce gross labor mobility. (5) Mandated benefits increase labor costs and reduce employment modestly while the costs of others is shifted largely to labor, with some variation among countries. (6) Contrary to the Harris-Todaro two-sector model in which rural-urban migration adjusts to produce a positive relation between unemployment and wages across regions and sectors, wages and unemployment are inversely related by the "wage curve." (7) Unions affect nonwage outcomes as well as wage outcomes. (8) Cross-country regressions yield inconclusive results on the impact of labor regulations on growth while studies of country adjustments to economic shocks, such as balance of payments problems, find no difference in the responses of countries by the strength of labor institutions. (9) Labor institution can be critical when countries experience great change, as in China's growth spurt and Argentina's preservation of social stability and democracy after its 2001-2002 economic collapse. Cooperative labor relations tend to produce better economic outcomes. (10) The informal sector increased its share of the work force in the developing world in the past two decades. The persistence of large informal sectors throughout the developing world, including countries with high rates of growth, puts a premium on increasing our knowledge of how informal sector labor markets work and finding institutions and policies to deliver social benefits to workers in that sector. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Academic experts frequently recommend policies and treatments. But how well do they anticipate the impact of different treatments? And how do their predictions compare to the predictions of non-experts? We analyze how 208 experts forecast the results of 15 treatments involving monetary and non-monetary motivators in a real-effort task. We compare these forecasts to those made by PhD students and non-experts: undergraduates, MBAs, and an online sample. We document seven main results. First, the average forecast of experts predicts quite well the experimental results. Second, there is a strong wisdom-of-crowds effect: the average forecast outperforms 96 percent of individual forecasts. Third, correlates of expertise---citations, academic rank, field, and contextual experience--do not improve forecasting accuracy. Fourth, experts as a group do better than non-experts, but not if accuracy is defined as rank ordering treatments. Fifth, measures of effort, confidence, and revealed ability are predictive of forecast accuracy to some extent, especially for non-experts. Sixth, using these measures we identify `superforecasters' among the non-experts who outperform the experts out of sample. Seventh, we document that these results on forecasting accuracy surprise the forecasters themselves. We present a simple model that organizes several of these results and we stress the implications for the collection of forecasts of future experimental results.},

After estimation of parameters using pre-program data, we evaluate the model's ability to predict and interpret the impact of the village fund intervention. Simulations from the model mirror the data in yielding a greater increase in consumption than credit, which is interpreted as evidence of credit constraints. A cost-benefit analysis using the model indicates that some households value the program much more than its per household cost, but overall the program costs 20 percent more than the sum of these benefits.},

The model captures the role of labor mobility frictions, goods mobility frictions, geographic factors, and input-output linkages in determining equilibrium allocations. We show how to solve the equilibrium of the model and take the model to the data without assuming that the economy is at a steady state and without estimating productivities, migration frictions, or trade costs, which can be difficult to identify. We calibrate the model to 22 sectors, 38 countries, and 50 U.S. states. We study how the rise in China's trade for the period 2000 to 2007 impacted U.S. households across more than a thousand U.S. labor markets distinguished by sector and state. We find that the China trade shock resulted in a loss of 0.8 million U.S. manufacturing jobs, about 25% of the observed decline in manufacturing employment from 2000 to 2007. The U.S. gains in the aggregate but, due to trade and migration frictions, the welfare and employment effects vary across U.S. labor markets. Estimated transition costs to the new long-run equilibrium are also heterogeneous and reflect the importance of accounting for labor dynamics.},

abstract = {I discuss economic and social sources of inequality and elaborate on the role of social networks in inequality, economic immobility, and economic inefficiencies. The lens of social networks clarifies how the entanglement of people's information, opportunities, and behaviors with those of their peers and communities leads to persistent differences in outcomes across groups in education, employment, health, income and wealth. The key role of homophily in dividing groups within the network is highlighted. A network perspective's policy implications differ substantially from a strictly economic perspective. I discuss the importance of "policy cocktails" that include aspects that are aimed at both the economic and social forces driving inequality. Look over our vast city, and what do we see? On one side a very few men richer by far than it is good for a man to be, and on the other side a great mass of men and women struggling and worrying and wearying to get a most pitiful living.},

@article{Banerjee2014,
abstract = {We examine individuals' abilities to identify the highly central people in their social networks, where centrality is defined by diffusion centrality (Banerjee et al., 2013), which characterizes a node's influence in spreading information. We first show that diffusion centrality nests standard centrality measures -- degree, eigenvector and Katz-Bonacich centrality -- as extreme special cases. Next, we show that boundedly rational individuals can, simply by tracking sources of gossip, identify who is central in their social network in the specific sense of having high diffusion centrality. Finally, we examine whether the model's predictions are consistent with data in which we ask people in each of 35 villages whom would be the most effective point from which to initiate a diffusion process. We find that individuals accurately nominate central individuals in the diffusion centrality sense. Additionally, the nominated individuals are more central in the network than "village leaders" as well as those who are most central in a GPS sense. This suggests that individuals can rank others according to their centrality in the networks even without knowing the network, and that eliciting network centrality of others simply by asking individuals may be an inexpensive research and policy tool.},

abstract = {Over the past 20 years, investment in human resources has taken center stage in the study of developing economies. A voluminous set of wage function estimates provides the basis for calculating market returns to education for virtually every country in the world. Studies have also looked at the effects of schooling on non-market outcomes. Since health, like schooling, is a form of human capital, one might expect it to also be related to labor market success. Employers have an incentive to raise wages above the minimum supply price of labor, and to exclude those in poorest health from the labor market because they are too costly to hire. There is a general consensus that income has a strong effect on demand for health. Work remains to be done on which dimensions of health matter, which population groups are most affected and under what labor market (or other) conditions health emerges as important. Questions of the impact of health dynamics, particularly in response negative economic shocks and aging, have barely been touched in low-income environments.},

Using longitudinal data from the Cape Area Panel Study (CAPS), we analyze the large racial gaps in the proportion of high school graduates who enroll in university and other forms of post-secondary education. Our results indicate that family background and high school achievement (measured by a literacy and numeracy exam and performance on the grade 12 matriculation exam) are strong predictors of post-secondary enrollment and statistically account for all of the black-white difference in enrollment. Controlling for parental education and baseline scholastic ability reduces the estimated impact of household income on university enrollment, though there continues to be an effect at the top of the income distribution. We also find evidence of credit constraints on non-university forms of post-secondary enrollment. Counterfactual estimates indicate that if all South Africans had the incomes of the richest whites, African university enrollment would increase by 65%, even without changing parental education or high school academic achievement. The racial gap in university enrollment would narrow only slightly, however as our results suggest that this gap in postsecondary enrollment results mainly from the large racial gap in high school academic achievement.},

abstract = {The increasing availability of passively observed data has yielded a growing methodological interest in "data fusion." These methods involve merging data from observational and experimental sources to draw causal conclusions -- and they typically require a precarious tradeoff between the unknown bias in the observational dataset and the often-large variance in the experimental dataset. We propose an alternative approach to leveraging observational data, which avoids this tradeoff: rather than using observational data for inference, we use it to design a more efficient experiment. We consider the case of a stratified experiment with a binary outcome, and suppose pilot estimates for the stratum potential outcome variances can be obtained from the observational study. We extend results from Zhao et al. (2019) in order to generate confidence sets for these variances, while accounting for the possibility of unmeasured confounding. Then, we pose the experimental design problem as one of regret minimization, subject to the constraints imposed by our confidence sets. We show that this problem can be converted into a convex minimization and solved using conventional methods. Lastly, we demonstrate the practical utility of our methods using data from the Women's Health Initiative.},

@article{Mookherjee2003,
abstract = {When human capital accumulation generates pecuniary externalities across professions, and capital markets are imperfect, persistent inequality in utility and consumption is inevitable in any steady state. This is true irrespective of the degree of divisibility in investments. However, divisibility (or fineness of occupational structure) has implications for both the multiplicity and Pareto-efficiency of steady states. Indivisibilities generate a continuum of inefficient and efficient steady states with varying per capita income. On the other hand, perfect divisibility typically implies the existence of a unique steady state distribution which is Pareto-efficient.},

@article{Gollin2016,
abstract = {We document several new facts regarding urbanization and structural change in de- veloping countries and develop a model that can account for them. Most developing countries follow a standard pattern: urbanization is a by-product of either a “push” from agricultural productivity growth or a “pull” from industrial productivity growth. In these countries urban- ization occurs with structural transformation and cities are “production cities”, with a mix of workers in tradable and non-tradable sectors. For a distinct subset of countries that rely on natural resource exports, however, urbanization has increased at an equally rapid pace, but it is not associated with an increased importance of manufacturing and services in GDP. In these countries urbanization has taken place in “consumption cities” where the mix of work- ers is heavily skewed towards non-tradable services. We adapt a standard model of structural transformation to explain how natural resources can both drive urbanization as well as shift the composition of the urban labor force. The model may help explain why natural resource exporters - and Sub-Saharan Africa in particular - have experienced urbanization without struc- tural transformation, which has implications for the pace of long-run growth in these areas.},

abstract = {In this article, we present ppmlhdfe, a new command for estimation of (pseudo-)Poisson regression models with multiple high-dimensional fixed effects (HDFE). Estimation is implemented using a modified version of the iteratively reweighted least-squares algorithm that allows for fast estimation in the presence of HDFE. Because the code is built around the reghdfe package (Correia, 2014, Statistical Software Components S457874, Department of Economics, Boston College), it has similar syntax, supports many of the same functionalities, and benefits from reghdfe‘s fast convergence properties for computing high-dimensional leastsquares problems. Performance is further enhanced by some new techniques we introduce for accelerating HDFE iteratively reweighted least-squares estimation specifically. ppmlhdfe also implements a novel and more robust approach to check for the existence of (pseudo)maximum likelihood estimates.},

@article{Lawry2014,
abstract = {The quantitative results presented are based on a corpus of 20 studies focusing on the impact of land rights recognition or formalization at the level of the farming household. In the Latin American and Asian cases, recognition typically took the form of freehold titling. The African studies assessed programs where rights were recognized through provision of freehold title, through formal registration of customary rights, or through conversion of customary rights to long-term leasehold rights. We were not able to identify any quantitative evidence of sufficient quality examining the investment or productivity effects of statutory recognition of customary land rights. The studies on freehold titling provide evidence mostly consistent with conventional economic theories of property rights. The limited quantitative evidence base suggests benefits of land tenure interventions, measured in terms of productivity and consumption expenditure or income, and suggests that long-term investment and increases in perceived tenure security are plausible channels through which tenure recognition may contribute to welfare for those who receive title. The credit channel finds no support, although the evidence base is very thin. When looking at the contextual factors that moderate the effects of tenure recognition, we find gains in productivity are significantly greater outside Africa and in wealthier settings, although strong correlation between the two makes it impossible for us to determine whether this is a “wealth effect,” or something we characterize as the “Africa effect”, defined as the effect of relatively high pre-existing levels of tenure security that characterize customary tenure arrangements. The evidence base is too thin to say how productivity and investment effects are moderated by our other contextual factors of interest, including length transpired since the intervention, levels of democratic governance, population density, agricultural systems, or cash crops. The quantitative evidence base has very little to say about consequences of such policies for social outcomes like displacement, conflict, or gender equality. Thus, while tenure recognition appears to improve land productivity and the material welfare of those who have access to registered land, we do not have a clear sense of the dynamics that follow from such policies in terms of overall access to land. We also have no quantitative evidence on policies that certify communal property rights, one of the forms of property rights enhancement that motivated our interest in this review.},

A voluminous literature has emerged for modeling the temporal dependen-cies in financial market volatility using ARCH and stochastic volatility models. While most of these studies have documented highly significant in-sample parameter estimates and pronounced intertemporal volatility persistence, tradi-tional ex-post forecast evaluation criteria suggest that the models provide seemingly poor volatility forecasts. Contrary to this contention, we show that volatility models produce strikingly accurate interdaily forecasts for the latent volatility factor that would be of interest in most financial applications. New methods for improved ex-post interdaily volatility measurements based on high-frequency intradaily data are also discussed.},

abstract = {Until recently, neither climate nor conflict have been core areas of inquiry within economics, but there has been an explosion of research on both topics in the past decade, with a particularly large body?of research emerging at their intersection. In this review, we survey this literature on the interlinkages between climate and conflict, by necessity drawing from both economics and other disciplines given the inherent interdisciplinarity of research in this field. We consider many types of human conflict in the review, including both interpersonal conflict — such as domestic violence, road rage, assault, murder, and rape — and intergroup conflict — including riots, ethnic violence, land invasions, gang?violence, civil war and other forms of political instability, such as coups. We discuss the key methodological?issues in estimating causal relationships in this area, and largely focus on "natural experiments" that?exploit variation in climate variables over time, helping to address omitted variable bias concerns.?After harmonizing statistical specifications and standardizing estimated effect sizes within each conflict?category, we carry out a hierarchical meta-analysis that allows us to estimate the mean effect of climate?variation on conflict outcomes as well as to quantify the degree of variability in this effect size across?studies. Looking across 55 studies, we find that deviations from moderate temperatures and precipitation?patterns systematically increase the risk of conflict, often substantially, with average effects that are highly statistically significant. We find that contemporaneous temperature has the largest average effect by far, with each 1?$\sigma$ increase toward warmer temperatures increasing the frequency of contemporaneous interpersonal conflict by 2.4% and of intergroup conflict by 11.3%, but that the 2-period cumulative effect of rainfall on intergroup conflict is also substantial (3.5%/?$\sigma$). We also quantify heterogeneity in these effect estimates across settings that is likely important. We conclude by highlighting remaining challenges in this field and the approaches we expect will be most effective at solving them, including identifying mechanisms that link climate to conflict, measuring the ability of societies to adapt to climate changes, and understanding the likely impacts of future global warming.

@article{Mani2013,
abstract = {The poor often behave in less capable ways, which can further perpetuate poverty. We hypothesize that poverty directly impedes cognitive function and present two studies that test this hypothesis. First, we experimentally induced thoughts about finances and found that this reduces cognitive performance among poor but not in well-off participants. Second, we examined the cognitive function of farmers over the planting cycle. We found that the same farmer shows diminished cognitive performance before harvest, when poor, as compared with after harvest, when rich. This cannot be explained by differences in time available, nutrition, or work effort. Nor can it be explained with stress: Although farmers do show more stress before harvest, that does not account for diminished cognitive performance. Instead, it appears that poverty itself reduces cognitive capacity. We suggest that this is because poverty-related concerns consume mental resources, leaving less for other tasks. These data provide a previously unexamined perspective and help explain a spectrum of behaviors among the poor. We discuss some implications for poverty policy.},

CF methods often can be justifi ed in situations where "plug- in" approaches are known to produce inconsistent estimators of parameters and partial effects. Usually, CF approaches require fewer assumptions than maximum likelihood, and CF methods are computationally simpler. The recent focus on estimating average partial effects, along with theoretical results on nonparametric identifi cation, suggests some simple, fl exible parametric CF strategies. The CF approach for handling discrete EEVs in nonlinear models is more controversial but approximate solutions are available.},

abstract = {Large and regular seasonal price fluctuations in local grain markets appear to offer African farmers substantial inter-temporal arbitrage opportunities, but these opportunities remain largely unexploited: small-scale farmers are commonly observed to “sell low and buy high” rather than the reverse. In a field experiment in Kenya, we show that creditmarket imperfections limit farm- ers' abilities to move grain intertemporally, and that providing timely access to credit allows farmers to purchase at lower prices and sell at higher prices, increasing farm profits. To under- stand general equilibrium effects of these changes in behavior, we vary the density of loan offers across locations. We document significant effects of the credit intervention on seasonal price dispersion in local grain markets, and show that these GE effects strongly affect our individual level profitability estimates. In contrast to existing experimental work, our results indicate a setting in which microcredit can improve firm profitability, and suggest that GE effects can substantially shape estimates of microcredit's effectiveness.

abstract = {published reports have been used selectively, as most studies that are cited had an experimental or quasi-experimental research design with a focus on causality. A broader view, including discussion of methods and research designs and descriptions of particular studies, is available elsewhere (8, 31, 33, 48). Among the many different pathways through which iron deficiency can affect cognition (see Table 1) are two that have been most frequently discussed. Briefly, one proposes that even at the very early stages of iron deficiency, a decrement in iron-dependent dopamine D2 receptors in the cortex alters dopamine neurotransmission, which, in tum, impairs cognitive function (16, 45, 48-50). The alternative hypothesis is less explicit and refers to more advanced stages of iron deficiency when hemoglobin concentration is compromised. It postulates that in the presence of anemia there may be systemic effects that interfere with cognition (16). Neither hypothesis has been validated; however, most research in this area has focused on dopamine neurotransmission. The following review is divided into four sections. First I discuss some issues of definition regarding both predictor (i.e. iron deficiency) and outcome (i.e. cognition) variables .. Next, I discuss the associations that have been reported for iron deficiency anemia (IDA) without addressing the issue of causality, which is covered in the third section. The review ends with an attempt to make explicit the nature of the cognitive alterations found among children with IDA.},

We show here that TSLS can also be used to estimate the average causal effect of variable treatments such as drug dosage, hours of exam preparation, cigarette smoking, and years of schooling. The average causal effect in which we are interested is a conditional expectation of the difference between the outcomes of the treated and what these outcomes would have been in the absence of treatment. Given mild regularity assumptions, the probability limit of TSLS is a weighted average of per-unit average causal effects along the length of an appropriately defined causal response function. The weighting function is illustrated in an empirical example based on the relationship between schooling and earning.},

@article{Rijkers2010,
abstract = {Summary\nThe Addis Ababa Integrated Housing Development Program (AAIHDP) aims to tackle the housing shortage and unemployment that prevail in Addis Ababa by deploying and supporting small enterprises to construct low-cost housing using technologies novel for Ethiopia. The motivation for such support is predicated on the view that small firms create more jobs per unit of investment by virtue of being more labor intensive and that the jobs so created are concentrated among the low-skilled and hence the poor. To assess whether the program has succeeded in biasing technology adoption in favor of labor and thereby contributed to poverty reduction, the impact of the program on technology usage, labor intensity, and earnings is investigated using a unique matched workers-firms dataset, the Addis Ababa Construction Enterprise Survey (AACES), collected specifically for the purpose of analyzing the impact of the program. We find that program firms do not adopt different technologies and are not more labor intensive than nonprogram firms. There is an earnings premium for program participants, who tend to be relatively well educated, which is heterogeneous and highest for those at the bottom of the earnings distribution.},

abstract = {This book is an introduction to the field of asymptotic statistics. The treatment is both practical and mathematically rigorous. In addition to most of the standard topics of an asymptotics course, including likelihood inference, M-estimation, the theory of asymptotic efficiency, U-statistics, and rank procedures, the book also presents recent research topics such as semiparametric models, the bootstrap, and empirical processes and their applications. The topics are organized from the central idea of approximation by limit experiments, which gives the book one of its unifying themes. This entails mainly the local approximation of the classical i.i.d. set up with smooth parameters by location experiments involving a single, normally distributed observation. Thus, even the standard subjects of asymptotic statistics are presented in a novel way. Suitable as a graduate or Master s level statistics text, this book will also give researchers an overview of the latest research in asymptotic statistics.},

We nonparametrically es- timate the impact of LIHTC development on nearby house prices by developing a new di¤erence-in-di¤erences style estimator which exploits smoothness in housing prices across geographic distance and time. We nd LIHTC development helps revitalize low income neighborhoods, driving up house prices 6.5%, lowering crime rates, and at- tracting a more racially and income diverse population. LIHTC development in higher income, low minority areas leads to local house price declines of 2.5% and attracts lower income households. We link these housing price e¤ects to homeowner and renter preferences by developing a generalized hedonic model. Our estimates indicate that an a¤ordable housing development in a low-income area improves welfare by $23,000 per local homeowner and $6500 per local renter, with aggregate welfare bene ts to society of $115 million. When viewed as a place-based policy, a¤ordable housing appears to be a desirable way to invest in and revitalize low-income communities.},

The authors illustrate a model-based method to standardize observed trial results to a specified target population using a seminal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment trial, and they provide Monte Carlo simulation evidence supporting the method. The example trial enrolled 1,156 HIV-infected adult men and women in the United States in 1996, randomly assigned 577 to a highly active antiretroviral therapy and 579 to a largely ineffective combination therapy, and followed participants for 52 weeks. The target population was US people infected with HIV in 2006, as estimated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results from the trial apply, albeit muted by 12%, to the target population, under the assumption that the authors have measured and correctly modeled the determinants of selection that reflect heterogeneity in the treatment effect. In simulations with a heterogeneous treatment effect, a conventional intent-to-treat estimate was biased with poor confidence limit coverage, but the proposed estimate was largely unbiased with appropriate confidence limit coverage. The proposed method standardizes observed trial results to a specified target population and thereby provides information regarding the generalizability of trial results.},

abstract = {More than one billion people worldwide live in rural areas without access to the paved road network. How does the lack of such infrastructure affect rural employment and economic outcomes? We construct a comprehensive, high spatial resolution dataset of 825 million individuals in rural India to estimate the impact of a national rural road construction program that has built paved roads to over 100,000 villages since 2000. Program rules provide discontinuities in the probability of treatment at multiple village population thresholds, which we exploit using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design. Road construction to previously unconnected villages leads to a 10 percentage point reduction in the share of households and workers in agriculture, with an equivalent increase in wage labor market participation. This sectoral reallocation is concentrated among males and households with low levels of land, precisely those groups who have the lowest costs and highest returns to sectoral reallocation. Labor reallocation to wage labor is strongest in locations close to major cities, sug- gesting the importance of access to urban markets in the process of structural transformation. Rather than facilitating growth of nonfarm firms in treated villages, rural roads enable workers to access external labor markets. We also provide evidence for gains to multiple measures of economic outcomes. Our results suggest that poor rural transportation infrastructure is a major con- straint on the sectoral allocation of labor in low income countries.},

abstract = {We consider the classic problem of estimating group treatment effects, such as school ef- fects, on an outcome when people sort into groups based on observed and unobserved individ- ual characteristics that affect the outcome. We show that under some circumstances standard choice models imply that group averages of observed individual-level characteristics can serve as controls for all of the across-group variation in the unobservable individual characteristics. This permits estimation of a lower bound for the variance of group treatment effects across groups. We use the idea to provide lower bound estimates of the effect of school systems and associated neighborhoods on high school graduation, college attendance, and earnings. Across three data sets, our most conservative estimates indicate that choosing a 90th quantile school and surrounding community instead of a 10th quantile school increases the probability of high school graduation by between 0.047 and 0.085 and increases the college attendance probability by between 0.11 and 0.13. We also find large effects on adult earnings. We discuss a number of applications of our methodology, including the measurement of teacher value added.},

abstract = {Summary: The current evidence on handwashing and sanitation programs suggests limited impacts on health when at-scale interventions have been tested in isolation. However, no published experimental evidence currently exists that tests the interaction effects between sanitation and handwashing. We present the results of two large-scale, government-led handwashing and sanitation promotion campaigns in rural Tanzania, with the objective of tracing the causal chain from hygiene and sanitation promotion to changes in child health outcomes and specifically testing for potential interaction effects of combining handwashing and sanitation interventions. Methods: The study is a factorial cluster-randomized control trial where 181 rural wards from 10 districts in Tanzania were randomly assigned to receive sanitation promotion, handwashing promotion, both interventions together or neither (control). Interventions were rolled out from February 2009 to June 2011 and the endline survey was conducted from May to November 2012, approximately one year after program completion. The sample was composed of households with children under 5 years old in the two largest villages in each ward. Masking was not possible due to the nature of the intervention, but enumerators played no part in the intervention and were blinded to treatment status. The primary outcome of interest was 7-day diarrhea prevalence for children under five. Intermediate outcomes of behavior change including improved latrine construction, levels of open defecation and handwashing with soap were also analyzed. Secondary health outcomes included anemia, height-for-age and weight-for-age of children under 5. An intention-to-treat analysis was used to assess the relationship between the interventions and outcomes of interest. Findings: One year after the end of the program, ownership of improved latrines increased from 49.7% to 64.8% (95% CI 57.9%-71.7%) and regular open defecation decreased from 23.1% to 11.1% (95% CI 3.5%-18.7%) in sanitation promotion-only wards. Households in handwashing promotion-only wards showed marginal improvements in handwashing behavior related to food preparation but not at other critical junctures. There were no detectable interaction effects for the combined intervention. The associated cost-per-household gaining access to improved sanitation is estimated to be USD $194. Final effects on child health measured through diarrhea, anemia, stunting and wasting were absent in all treatment groups. Interpretation: Although statistically significant, the changes in intermediate outcomes achieved through each intervention in isolation were not large enough to generate meaningful health impacts. With no observable signs of interaction, the combined intervention produced similar results. The study highlights the importance of focusing on intermediate outcomes of take up and behavior change as a critical first step in large-scale programs before realizing the changes in health that sanitation and hygiene interventions aim to deliver.

abstract = {This chapter focuses on the design and statistical properties of event study methods. Event studies examine the behavior of firms' stock prices around corporate events. A vast literature on event studies written over the past several decades has become an important part of financial economics. Prior to that time, "there was little evidence on the central issues of corporate finance. The number of published event studies exceeds 500, and the literature continues to grow. This chapter provides an overview of event study methods. Short-horizon methods are quite reliable. While long-horizon methods have improved, serious limitations remain. A challenge is to continue to refine long-horizon methods. This chapter also presents new evidence illustrating that properties of event study methods can vary by calendar time period and can depend on event sample firm characteristics such as volatility. This reinforces the importance of using stratified samples to examine event study statistical properties. This chapter highlights key econometric issues in event study methods, and summarizes what is known about the statistical design and the interpretation of event study experiments. Based on the theoretical and empirical findings of the methodology literature, it provides clear guidelines both for producers and consumers of event studies. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Many of the world's poor consume very few calories; one-seventh of the world's population remains below recommended intake levels. Yet, the impact of this nominally low caloric intake on productivity is unclear. This paper presents two analyses which find that changes in caloric intake result in substantial and broadly generalizable changes in productivity among malnourished adults in India. The first draws on a five-week randomized controlled trial among cycle-rickshaw drivers in Chennai, in which half of the participants received an additional 700 calories per day. Treated individuals showed significant improvements in both physical and cognitive tasks and increased labor supply and income by approximately 10 percent by the final week. The second study examines the impact of a 700 calorie per day decline in intake, caused by fasting during Ramadan, on agricultural production. This analysis leverages heterogeneity in cropping cycles between and within districts as well as the fact that Ramadan cycles throughout the calendar year to generate three sources of variation in the overlap between fasting and the labor intensive portions of the cropping cycle. Using a triple-difference approach, I find that overlap between Ramadan and the labor intensive portions of cropping cycles results in declines in production which correspond to a 20 to 40 percent decrease in productivity per fasting individual. Multiple sources of evidence suggest that production declines are driven primarily by reduced caloric intake rather than by other behavioral changes during Ramadan. The estimated return to investment in additional calories is positive, with point estimates of 65 percent over six months in the randomized trial and 225 percent over one month during Ramadan fasting. Given substantial evidence that traditionally hypothesized liquidity constraints do not meaningfully limit caloric consumption, the low caloric intake of the majority of Indian adults presents a puzzle in light of the high estimated returns. Responses from an incentivized survey suggest that inaccurate beliefs about both the returns to calories and the caloric content of foods may play a role in the low levels of caloric consumption.},

abstract = {Satellite images can provide valuable information about the presented urban landscape scenes to remote sensing and telecommunication applications. Obtaining information from satellite images is difficult since all the objects and their surroundings are presented with feature complexity. The shadows cast by buildings in urban scenes can be processed and used for estimating building heights. Thus, a robust and accurate building shadow detection process is important. Region-based active contour models can be used for satellite image segmentation. However, spectral heterogeneity that usually exists in satellite images and the feature similarity representing the shadow and several non-shadow regions makes building shadow detection challenging. In this work, a new automated method for delineating building shadows is proposed. Initially, spectral and spatial features of the satellite image are utilized for designing a custom filter to enhance shadows and reduce intensity heterogeneity. An effective iterative procedure using intensity differences is developed for tuning and subsequently selecting the most appropriate filter settings, able to highlight the building shadows. The response of the filter is then used for automatically estimating the radiometric property of the shadows. The customized filter and the radiometric feature are utilized to form an optimized active contour model where the contours are biased to delineate shadow regions. Post-processing morphological operations are also developed and applied for removing misleading artefacts. Finally, building heights are approximated using shadow length and the predefined or estimated solar elevation angle. Qualitative and quantitative measures are used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method for both shadow detection and building height estimation.},

The simulation design used is based on real data usually employed for the evaluation of labour market programmes in Germany. We vary several dimensions of the design that are of practical importance, like sample size, the type of the outcome variable, and aspects of the selection process. We find that trimming individual observations with too much weight as well as the choice of tuning parameters are important for all estimators. A conclusion from our simulations is that a particular radius matching estimator combined with regression performs best overall, in particular when robustness to misspecifications of the propensity score and different types of outcome variables is considered an important property. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {More than 19 percent of people in American central cities are poor. In suburbs, just 7.5 percent of people live in poverty. The income elasticity of demand for land is too low for urban poverty to come from wealthy individuals' wanting to live where land is cheap (the traditional explanation of urban poverty). A significant income elasticity for land exists only because the rich eschew apartment living, and that elasticity is still too low to explain the poor's urbanization. The urbanization of poverty comes mainly from better access to public transportation in central cities. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The six randomized evaluations in this volume use a variety of sampling, data collection, experimental design, and econometric strategies to identify causal effects of expanded access to microcredit on borrowers and/or communities. These methods are deployed across an impressive range of locations—six countries on four continents, urban and rural areas—borrower characteristics, loan characteristics, and lender characteristics. Summarizing and interpreting results across studies, we note a consistent pattern of modestly positive, but not transformative, effects. We also discuss directions for future research.

abstract = {This paper introduces the model confidence set (MCS) and applies it to the selection of models. A MCS is a set of models that is constructed such that it will contain the best model with a given level of confidence. The MCS is in this sense analogous to a confidence interval for a parameter. The MCS acknowledges the limitations of the data, such that uninformative data yield a MCSwith many models, whereas informative data yield a MCS with only a few models. The MCS procedure does not assume that a particular model is the true model; in fact, the MCS procedure can be used to compare more general objects, beyond the comparison of models.We apply the MCS procedure to two empirical problems. First, we revisit the inflation forecasting problem posed by Stock and Watson (1999), and compute the MCS for their set of inflation forecasts. Second, we compare a number of Taylor rule regressions and determine the MCS of the best regression in terms of in-sample likelihood criteria.},

The probabilities and intensities of manure use were investigated with the correlated random effects (CRE) probit and tobit models. The endogeneity of access to fertilizer subsidies and fertilizer use intensity was controlled for with a control function approach. Both the probability of manure use and intensity of manure use were positively correlated with the intensity of fertilizer use. A 1% increase in fertilizer use intensity is associated with a 1.94%–1.96% increase in the intensity of manure use outside the subsidy program and a 0.62%–1.66% increase in manure use with the subsidy program. A 1% increase in average fertilizer price was associated with a 0.43%–0.76% increase in the probability of manure use and a 3.5%–5.3% increase in the intensity of manure use.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the effect of market concentration and product differentiation on the observed outcomes of competition among oligopolists. The empirical framework is designed to examine whether competition is less intense in markets with equal levels of concentration but more differentiation among the products offered. A two-stage estimation procedure is proposed to address the endogeneity problem inherent in comparing outcomes across different market structures. I estimate the competitive effects using data from a cross section of oligopoly motel markets located along U.S. interstate highways. The results indicate that firms benefit substantially by offering differentiated products. The presence of any market competitor drives down prices, but the effect is much smaller when the competitor is a different product type. Differentiation is optimal product choice behavior because the resulting competition among firms is less tough when their products are differentiated.},

Its central features are (1) use of the “tick” loss function, (2) a conditional approach to out-of-sample evaluation, and (3) derivation in an environment with asymptotically nonvanishing estimation uncertainty. Our approach is valid under general conditions; the forecasts can be based on nested or nonnested models and can be obtained by general estimation procedures. We illustrate the test properties in a Monte Carlo experiment and apply it to evaluate and compare four popular value-at-risk models.},

abstract = {In complicated/nonlinear parametric models, it is generally hard to know whether the model parameters are point identified. We provide computationally attractive procedures to construct confidence sets (CSs) for identified sets of full parameters and of subvectors in models defined through a likelihood or a vector of moment equalities or inequalities. These CSs are based on level sets of optimal sample criterion functions (such as likelihood or optimally-weighted or continuously-updated GMM criterions). The level sets are constructed using cutoffs that are computed via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations directly from the quasi-posterior distributions of the criterions. We establish new Bernstein-von Mises (or Bayesian Wilks) type theorems for the quasi-posterior distributions of the quasi-likelihood ratio (QLR) and profile QLR in partially-identified regular models and some non-regular models. These results imply that our MC CSs have exact asymptotic frequentist coverage for identified sets of full parameters and of subvectors in partially-identified regular models, and have valid but potentially conservative coverage in models with reduced-form parameters on the boundary. Our MC CSs for identified sets of subvectors are shown to have exact asymptotic coverage in models with singularities. We also provide results on uniform validity of our CSs over classes of DGPs that include point and partially identified models. We demonstrate good finite-sample coverage properties of our procedures in two simulation experiments. Finally, our procedures are applied to two non-trivial empirical examples: an airline entry game and a model of trade flows.},

abstract = {M achines are increasingly doing " intelligent " things: Facebook recognizes faces in photos, Siri understands voices, and Google translates websites. The fundamental insight behind these breakthroughs is as much statis-tical as computational. Machine intelligence became possible once researchers stopped approaching intelligence tasks procedurally and began tackling them empirically. Face recognition algorithms, for example, do not consist of hard-wired rules to scan for certain pixel combinations, based on human understanding of what constitutes a face. Instead, these algorithms use a large dataset of photos labeled as having a face or not to estimate a function f (x) that predicts the pres-ence y of a face from pixels x. This similarity to econometrics raises questions: Are these algorithms merely applying standard techniques to novel and large datasets? If there are fundamentally new empirical tools, how do they fit with what we know? As empirical economists, how can we use them? 1 We present a way of thinking about machine learning that gives it its own place in the econometric toolbox. Central to our understanding is that machine learning 1 In this journal, Varian (2014) provides an excellent introduction to many of the more novel tools and " tricks " from machine learning, such as decision trees or cross-validation. Einav and Levin (2014) describe big data and economics more broadly. Belloni, Chernozhukov, and Hanson (2014) present an econometrically thorough introduction on how LASSO (and close cousins) can be used for inference in high-dimensional data.

abstract = {This article incorporates consumer learning and heterogeneity into a dynamic oligopoly model for the prescription drug market. In the model, both firms and patients need to learn the generic qualities via patients experiences, generic firms entry decisions are endogenous, but their entry timings depend on a random approval process. I apply the model to examine the impact of shortening the expected generic approval time. Although this policy experiment brings generics to the market sooner, it increases a potential entrants likelihood of entering a crowded market and hence could reduce the total number of generic entrants and consumer welfare.},

@article{Zubizarreta2015,
abstract = {Weighting methods that adjust for observed covariates, such as inverse probability weighting, are widely used for causal inference and estimation with incomplete outcome data. Part of the appeal of such methods is that one set of weights can be used to estimate a range of treatment effects based on different outcomes, or a variety of population means for several variables. However, this appeal can be diminished in practice by the instability of the estimated weights and by the difficulty of adequately adjusting for observed covariates in some settings. To address these limitations, this article presents a new weighting method that finds the weights of minimum variance that adjust or balance the empirical distribution of the observed covariates up to levels prespecified by the researcher. This method allows the researcher to balance very precisely the means of the observed covariates and other features of their marginal and joint distributions, such as variances and correlations and also, for example, the quantiles of interactions of pairs and triples of observed covariates, thus, balancing entire two- and three-way marginals. Since the weighting method is based on a well-defined convex optimization problem, duality theory provides insight into the behavior of the variance of the optimal weights in relation to the level of covariate balance adjustment, answering the question, how much does tightening a balance constraint increases the variance of the weights? Also, the weighting method runs in polynomial time so relatively large datasets can be handled quickly. An implementation of the method is provided in the new package sbw for R. This article shows some theoretical properties of the resulting weights and illustrates their use by analyzing both a dataset from the 2010 Chilean earthquake and a simulated example.},

@article{Masten2017,
abstract = {A breakdown frontier is the boundary between the set of assumptions which lead to a specific conclusion and those which do not. In a potential outcomes model with a binary treatment, we consider two conclusions: First, that ATE is at least a specific value (e.g., nonnegative) and second that the proportion of units who benefit from treatment is at least a specific value (e.g., at least 50%). For these conclusions, we derive the breakdown frontier for two kinds of assumptions: one which indexes deviations from random assignment of treatment, and one which indexes deviations from rank invariance. These classes of assumptions nest both the point identifying assumptions of random assignment and rank invariance and the opposite end of no constraints on treatment selection or the dependence structure between potential outcomes. This frontier provides a quantitative measure of robustness of conclusions to deviations in the point identifying assumptions. We derive $\sqrt{N}$-consistent sample analog estimators for these frontiers. We then provide an asymptotically valid bootstrap procedure for constructing lower uniform confidence bands for the breakdown frontier. As a measure of robustness, this confidence band can be presented alongside traditional point estimates and confidence intervals obtained under point identifying assumptions. We illustrate this approach in an empirical application to the effect of child soldiering on wages. We find that conclusions are fairly robust to failure of rank invariance, when random assignment holds, but conclusions are much more sensitive to both assumptions for small deviations from random assignment.},

abstract = {Evaluations of the impact of social programs are often carried out in multiple " sites, " such as school districts, housing authorities, local TANF offices, or One-Stop Career Centers. Most evaluations select sites purposively following a process that is nonrandom. Unfortunately, purposive site selection can produce a sample of sites that is not representative of the population of interest for the program. In this paper, we propose a conceptual model of purposive site selection. We begin with the proposition that a purposive sample of sites can usefully be conceptualized as a random sample of sites from some well-defined population, for which the sampling probabilities are unknown and vary across sites. This proposition allows us to derive a formal, yet intuitive, mathematical expression for the bias in the pooled impact estimate when sites are selected purposively. This formula helps us to better understand the consequences of selecting sites purposively, and the factors that contribute to the bias. Additional research is needed to obtain evidence on how large the bias tends to be in actual studies that select sites purposively, and to develop methods to increase the external validity of these studies.},

@article{Basu2011,
abstract = {The paper puts forward a small but novel idea of how we can cut down the incidence of bribery. There are different kinds of bribes and what this paper is concerned with are bribes that people often have to give to get what they are legally entitled to. I shall call these ―harassment bribes.‖ Suppose an income tax refund is held back from a taxpayer till he pays some cash to the officer. Suppose government allots subsidized land to a person but when the person goes to get her paperwork done and receive documents for this land, she is asked to pay a hefty bribe. These are all illustrations of harassment bribes. Harassment bribery is widespread in India and it plays a large role in breeding inefficiency and has a corrosive effect on civil society. The central message of this paper is that we should declare the act of giving a bribe in all such cases as legitimate activity. In other words the giver of a harassment bribe should have full immunity from any punitive action by the state. It is argued that this will cause a sharp decline in the incidence of bribery. The reasoning is that once the law is altered in this manner, after the act of bribery is committed, the interests of the bribe giver and the bribe taker will be at divergence. The bribe giver will be willing to cooperate in getting the bribe taker caught. Knowing that this will happen, the bribe taker will be deterred from taking a bribe. It should be emphasized that what is being argued in this paper is not a retrospective pardon for bribe-giving. Retrospective pardons are like amnesties. They encourage rather than discourage corrupt behavior by rewarding the corrupt. And, in the process, they corrode society‘s morals. 3},

abstract = {Micronutrient deficiencies, especially those related to iodine and iron, are linked to different cognitive impairments, as well as to potential long-term behavioral changes. Among the cognitive impairments caused by iron deficiency, those referring to attention span, intelligence, and sensory perception functions are mainly cited, as well as those associated with emotions and behavior, often directly related to the presence of iron deficiency anemia. In addition, iron deficiency without anemia may cause cognitive disturbances. At present, the prevalence of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia is 2%-6% among European children. Given the importance of iron deficiency relative to proper cognitive development and the alterations that can persist through adulthood as a result of this deficiency, the objective of this study was to review the current state of knowledge about this health problem. The relevance of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia, the distinction between the cognitive consequences of iron deficiency and those affecting specifically cognitive development, and the debate about the utility of iron supplements are the most relevant and controversial topics. Despite there being methodological differences among studies, there is some evidence that iron supplementation improves cognitive functions. Nevertheless, this must be confirmed by means of adequate follow-up studies among different groups.},

abstract = {Novel computer vision architectures monopolize the spotlight, but the impact of the model architecture is often conflated with simultaneous changes to training methodology and scaling strategies. Our work revisits the canonical ResNet (He et al., 2015) and studies these three aspects in an effort to disentangle them. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that training and scaling strategies may matter more than architectural changes, and further, that the resulting ResNets match recent state-of-the-art models. We show that the best performing scaling strategy depends on the training regime and offer two new scaling strategies: (1) scale model depth in regimes where overfitting can occur (width scaling is preferable otherwise); (2) increase image resolution more slowly than previously recommended (Tan & Le, 2019). Using improved training and scaling strategies, we design a family of ResNet architectures, ResNet-RS, which are 1.7x - 2.7x faster than EfficientNets on TPUs, while achieving similar accuracies on ImageNet. In a large-scale semi-supervised learning setup, ResNet-RS achieves 86.2% top-1 ImageNet accuracy, while being 4.7x faster than EfficientNet NoisyStudent. The training techniques improve transfer performance on a suite of downstream tasks (rivaling state-of-the-art self-supervised algorithms) and extend to video classification on Kinetics-400. We recommend practitioners use these simple revised ResNets as baselines for future research.},

abstract = {A complete theory for evaluating interval forecasts has not been worked out to date. Most of the literature implicitly assumes homoskedastic errors even when this is clearly violated and proceed by merely testing for correct unconditional coverage. Consequently, the author sets out to build a consistent framework for conditional interval forecast evaluation, which is crucial when higher-order moment dynamics are present. The new methodology is demonstrated in an application to the exchange rate forecasting procedures advocated in risk management.

The mechanisms underlying these consumption effects are increases in remittances received and the diversity of senders.

abstract = {The goal of this paper is to detect collusion and estimate its effect on the seller's revenue in first-price auctions with independent, private valuations. The challenge is that collusion may be difficult to detect because colluders can use a simple and costless strategy to make their bids appear competitive. If the econometrician observes an exogenous shifter of the level of competition at the auction in addition to the winning bids, a statistical test for collusion can be formulated as a test of independence between the exogenous shifter and the valuations that rationalize the bids under the null hypothesis that it is not colluding. Simulations confirm that this test performs well even when colluders attempt to disguise their behavior. I then adopt a multiple hypothesis testing framework to simultaneously test for collusion bidder-by-bidder. By controlling the probability of making one or more type I errors, the set of rejected hypotheses forms a lower confidence bound on the set of colluders. In order to produce a lower confidence bound on the cost of collusion, I use consistent estimates of the bidders' valuation distributions to numerically solve for the seller's expected revenues in auctions with and without collusion. As an example of this identification strategy, I use exogenous variation in the reserve prices at British Columbia's timber auctions to estimate the extent of collusion in the years preceding a lumber trade dispute between the US and Canada.},

But the objectives of these programs are not only to increase human capital investments with implications for future levels and distributions of income but also to alleviate current poverty and reduce current inequality. The current distributional gains from such programs depend on the degree of inequality aversion in the social welfare function. Simulations show that, for a range of inequality aversion parameters, the welfare gains from current redistribution for the Mexican PROGRESA CCT program can be as large, or possibly much larger, than the estimated present discounted value of future earnings from human capital investments in lower and upper secondary schooling. These, moreover, are underestimates of the gains from redistribution because, in addition to current gains, such gains will be augmented in the future through the distribution of the returns on the human capital investments induced by cash transfer programs. Therefore, to fully evaluate such programs, it is critical to incorporate the distributional gains, not only the impacts on human capital investments.},

The key to the MCS is that it acknowledges the limitations of the information in the data. The empirical exercise is based on 55 volatility models and the MCS includes about a third of these when evaluated by mean square error, whereas the MCS contains only a VGARCH model when mean absolute deviation criterion is used. We conduct a simulation study which shows that the MCS captures the superior models across a range of significance levels. When we benchmark the MCS relative to a Bonferroni bound, the latter delivers inferior performance.},

abstract = {Urbanization often occurs in an unplanned and uneven manner, resulting in profound changes in patterns of land cover and land use. Understanding these changes is fundamental for devising environmentally responsible approaches to economic development in the rapidly urbanizing countries of the emerging world. One indicator of urbanization is built-up land cover that can be detected and quantified at scale using satellite imagery and cloud-based computational platforms. This process requires reliable and comprehensive ground-truth data for supervised classification and for validation of classification products. We present a new dataset for India, consisting of 21,030 polygons from across the country that were manually classified as “built-up” or “not built-up,” which we use for supervised image classification and detection of urban areas. As a large and geographically diverse country that has been undergoing an urban transition, India represents an ideal context to develop and test approaches for the detection of features related to urbanization. We perform the analysis in Google Earth Engine (GEE) using three types of classifiers, based on imagery from Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 as inputs. The methodology produces high-quality maps of built-up areas across space and time. Although the dataset can facilitate supervised image classification in any platform, we highlight its potential use in GEE for temporal large-scale analysis of the urbanization process. Our methodology can easily be applied to other countries and regions.},

We propose two alternative estimators that do recover the SWE in the presence of group-specific heterogeneity. We derive tests to detect the presence of heterogeneous treatment effects and to distinguish between the OLS and SWE. We document that heterogeneous treatment effects are common and the SWE is often statistically and economically different from the OLS estimate by extending eight influential papers. In all but one paper, there is statistically significant treatment effect heterogeneity; in five, the SWE is statistically different from the OLS estimator; and in five, the SWE and OLS estimators are economically different.},

We introduce a class of estimating equations that give consistent estimates of the regression parameters and of their variance under mild assumptions about the time dependence. The estimating equations are derived without specifying the joint distribution of a subject's observations yet they reduce to the score equations for multivariate Gaussian outcomes. Asymptotic theory is presented for the general class of estimators. Specific cases in which we assume independence, m-dependence and exchangeable correlation structures from each subject are discussed. Efficiency of the proposed estimators in two simple situations is considered. The approach is closely related to quasi-likelihood.},

abstract = {Mobile money, a service that allows monetary value to be stored on a mobile phone and sent to other users via text messages, has been adopted by the vast majority of Kenyan households. We estimate that access to the Kenyan mobile money system M-PESA increased per capita consumption levels and lifted 194,000 households, or 2% of Kenyan households, out of poverty. The impacts, which are more pronounced for female-headed households, appear to be driven by changes in financial behavior - in particular, increased financial resilience and saving - and labor market outcomes, such as occupational choice, especially for women, who moved out of agriculture and into business. Mobile money has therefore increased the efficiency of the allocation of consumption over time while allowing a more efficient allocation of labor, resulting in a meaningful reduction of poverty in Kenya.},

Larger refugee inflows are reflected in two main trends: higher housing expenditures of all Jordanians and increments in rental income of individuals that own real estate property. The effects are explained by the large spike in rental prices that resulted from the higher demand for housing units and the unresponsive housing supply in refugee-hosting areas.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of using observational data to learn treatment assignment policies that satisfy certain constraints specified by a practitioner, such as budget, fairness, or functional form constraints. This problem has previously been studied in economics, statistics, and computer science, and several regret-consistent methods have been proposed. However, several key analytical components are missing, including a characterization of optimal methods for policy learning, and sharp bounds for minimax regret. In this paper, we derive lower bounds for the minimax regret of policy learning under constraints, and propose a method that attains this bound asymptotically up to a constant factor. Whenever the class of policies under consideration has a bounded Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, we show that the problem of minimax-regret policy learning can be asymptotically reduced to first efficiently evaluating how much each candidate policy improves over a randomized baseline, and then maximizing this value estimate. Our analysis relies on uniform generalizations of classical semiparametric efficiency results for average treatment effect estimation, paired with sharp concentration bounds for weighted empirical risk minimization that may be of independent interest.},

When agents' beliefs or behaviors are developed by averaging what they see among their neighbors, then convergence to a consensus is slowed by the presence of homophily but is not influenced by network density (in contrast to other network processes that depend on shortest paths). In deriving these results, we propose a new, general measure of homophily based on the relative frequencies of interactions among different groups. An application to communication in a society before a vote shows how the time it takes for the vote to correctly aggregate information depends on the homophily and the initial information distribution.

We compare American metropolitan areas with comparable geographic units in Brazil, China and India. Both Gibrat's Law and Zipf's Law seem to hold as well in Brazil as in the U.S., but China and India look quite different. In Brazil and China, the implications of the spatial equilibrium hypothesis, the central organizing idea of urban economics, are not rejected. The India data, however, repeatedly rejects tests inspired by the spatial equilibrium assumption. One hypothesis is that the spatial equilibrium only emerges with economic development, as markets replace social relationships and as human capital spreads more widely. In all four countries there is strong evidence of agglomeration economies and human capital externalities. The correlation between density and earnings is stronger in both China and India than in the U.S., strongest in China. In India the gap between urban and rural wages is huge, but the correlation between city size and earnings is modest. The cross-sectional relationship between area-level skills and both earnings and area-level growth are also stronger in the developing world than in the U.S. The forces that drive urban success seem similar in the rich and poor world, even if limited migration and difficult housing markets make it harder for a spatial equilibrium to develop.},

@article{Abraham2007,
abstract = {Over the past two decades the hospital industry has been experiencing extensive consolidation, especially during the second half of the 1990s. Approximately 1,000 mergers occurred between 1986 and 2000, and the number of general hospitals dropped from 6,035 in 1980 to 4,862 in 2000. At the same time, the number of private specialty hospitals has tripled from the 29 that existed in 1990. The wave of hospital consolidations, hospital closures, and the surge of specialty hospitals have altered the local market structure and the pattern of competition for hospital services, which has led to concern about competition within the industry. Analysis of entry and competition for medical service has proven difficult because hospital markets are characterized by heterogeneous products, asymmetric information, extensive government regulation, and the presence of nonprofit firms. Unlike most previous studies that analyze hospitals as a single product firm and define a single geographic market for each hospital, I examine forty-six different services provided by hospitals and assign different geographic markets to each of these special services based on the proportion of hospitals that provide them. Using hospital data from the Hospital Blue Book, I estimate an ordered probit model and find that entry of another hospital into a new area of service generally leads to a significant increase in competition; however, the competitive equilibrium is not reached for some services even after the third or fourth entry. In addition, I also find substantial economies of scale in providing most of the hospital services. The evidence presented in my dissertation indicates that applying antitrust policy to control health care expenditures could be a double-edged sword. Encouraging consolidations would facilitate hospitals to explore the substantial economies of scale but to gain market power; discouraging consolidations would reduce firms' economic efficiency and market power as well.},

abstract = {Studies of small-scale “model” early-childhood programs show that high-quality preschool can have transformative eﬀects on human capital and economic outcomes. Evidence on the Head Start program is more mixed. Inputs and practices vary widely across Head Start centers, however, and little is known about variation in eﬀectiveness within Head Start. This paper uses data from a multi-site randomized evaluation to quantify and explain variation in eﬀectiveness across Head Start childcare centers. I answer two questions: (1) How much do short-run eﬀects vary across Head Start centers? and (2) To what extent do inputs and practices explain this variation? To answer the ﬁrst q uestion, I d evelop a random coeﬃcients sample selection model that quantiﬁes h eterogeneity i n H ead S tart e ﬀects, a ccounting for non-compliance with experimental assignments. Empirical Bayes estimates of the model show that the cross-center standard deviation of cognitive eﬀects is 0.18 test score standard deviations, which is larger than typical estimates of variation in teacher or school eﬀectiveness. Next, I assess the role of inputs in generating this variation, focusing on inputs commonly cited as central to the success of model programs. My results show that Head Start centers oﬀering full-day service boost cognitive skills more than other centers, while Head Start centers oﬀering frequent home visiting are especially eﬀective at raising non-cognitive skills. Other key inputs, including the High/Scope curriculum, teacher education and certiﬁcation, and class size, are not associated with increased eﬀectiveness in Head Start. Together, observed inputs explain a small share of the variation in Head Start eﬀectiveness. An investigation of the role of counterfactual childcare choices suggests that cross-center diﬀerences in eﬀects may be partially due to diﬀerences in rates of private preschool attendance.},

We show that the associated test for bias is inappropriate before introducing a more suitable procedure which is based on the test for bias in a conditional mean forecast. Although volatility has been the most common measure of the variability in a financial time series, in many situations confidence interval forecasts are required. We consider the evaluation of interval forecasts and present a regression-based procedure which uses quantile regression to assess quantile estimator bias and variance. We use exchange rate data to illustrate the proposal by evaluating seven quantile estimators, one of which is a new non-parametric autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity quantile estimator. The empirical analysis shows that the new evaluation procedure provides useful insight into the quality of quantile estimators. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Balboni2020,
abstract = {There are two broad views as to why people stay poor. One emphasizes the role of economic fundamentals-for example, differences in individual traits like talent or motivation make the poor choose low productivity jobs. The other, the poverty traps view, emphasizes that access to opportunities depends on initial wealth and hence poor people have no choice but to work in low productivity jobs. We test the two views using the random allocation of an asset transfer program that gave some of the poorest women in Bangladesh access to the same job opportunities as their wealthier counterparts in the same villages. The data rejects the null of equal opportunities. Exploiting small variation in initial endowments, we estimate the transition equation and find that, if the program pushes individuals above a threshold level of initial assets, then they escape poverty, but, if it does not, they slide back into poverty. Structural estimation of an occupational choice model reveals that almost all beneficiaries are misallocated at baseline and that the gains arising from eliminating misallocation would far exceed the costs. Our findings imply that large one-off transfers that enable people to take on more productive occupations can help alleviate persistent poverty.},

@article{Munshi2014a,
abstract = {A nyone who has spent time in a developing country knows the importance of social connections, which can help individuals land jobs, and provide them with credit and other forms of support. At first glance, it might appear that such connections distort the economy by giving select individuals an unfair advantage. However, modern economics provides another perspective on this phenomenon, arguing that when markets function imperfectly, networks of socially connected individuals can enhance economic efficiency. For example, when the ability of new hires cannot be observed by the firm, incumbent workers will refer competent members of their community to their employers. These new hires will work diligently both so as not to let down the workers that referred them, and also to avoid the social sanctions they would face from their network if they were caught shirking. In this example, social connections solve information and commitment problems. Unlike information networks, which can be organized around casual acquain-tances or even anonymous online communities, networks that solve commitment problems must be based on strong social ties to support the sanctions that are needed to maintain cooperative behavior (Karlan, Mobius, Rosenblat, and Szeidl 2009; Dhillon, Iverson, and Torsvik 2013). Commitment networks will thus typi-cally be organized around close-knit communities that have been in place for long periods of time, sometimes spanning multiple generations. Depending on the context, these communities could be based on kinship (for example, castes in India and clans in sub-Saharan Africa) or on geographical proximity (neighborhoods or villages). Members of these well-established communities will work together success-fully to achieve common objectives, sacrificing immediate individual gain when they are sufficiently patient and when the threat of social sanctions is sufficiently severe. Although community networks may improve outcomes for their members, a major limitation of these informal institutions is that their benefits are restricted to select populations. For example, individuals from a small number of communi-ties that have established business networks (by historical good-fortune) will find it easier to receive the credit and support that they need to start a new business. However, other and possibly more-deserving individuals from other communities will be shut out. This misallocation of resources and talents when commu-nity networks are active was first documented in Banerjee and Munshi (2004). It explains, in part, why less-efficient firms may continue to operate in developing economies (Hsieh and Klenow 2009). It also has obvious consequences for the dynamics of development. When credit markets function imperfectly, modern growth theory tells us that wealth inequality can persist over many generations (Galor and Zeira 1993; Banerjee and Newman 1993). Once networks are added to the mix, new opportunities for mobility open up at the level of the community. Members of communities that are fortuitously able to establish new networks work together to overcome credit and other constraints, moving as a group to new locations and new occupations (Munshi 2011). The dynamics of the wealth distribution in the overall population will now be more complex, with networks forming and dissipating within and across communi-ties over the course of the development process. How this process actually unfolds will depend not only on the initial wealth distribution, but also on the commu-nity structure and the exogenous sequence of events that triggers the formation of new networks. My objective in this paper is to lay the groundwork for a new network-based theory of economic development. The first step is to establish that community-based networks are active throughout the developing world. Plenty of anecdotal and descriptive evidence supports this claim. However, showing that these networks improve the economic outcomes of their members is more of a challenge. Over the course of the paper I will present multiple strategies that have been employed to directly or indirectly identify network effects. The second step is to look beyond a static role for community networks, one of overcoming market failures and improving the outcomes of their members in the short-run, to examine how these informal institutions can support group mobility. A volu-minous literature documents the involvement of communities in internal and international migration, both historically and in the contemporary economy. As with the static analysis, the challenge here is to show statistically that community networks directly support the movement of groups of individuals. I will show how predictions from the theory can be used to infer a link between networks and migration in very different contexts.},

Components of the gains known to the agents and acted on by them may not be known by the observing economist. Such models are called correlated random coe cient models. Sorting on unobserved components of gains complicates the interpretation of what IV estimates. This paper examines testable implications of the hypothesis that agents do not sort into treatment based on gains. In it, we develop new tests to gauge the empirical relevance of the correlated random coe cient model to examine whether the additional complications associated with it are required. We examine the power of the proposed tests. We derive a new representation of the variance of the instrumental variable estimator for the correlated random coefficient model. We apply the methods in this paper to the prototypical empirical problem of estimating the return to schooling and nd evidence of sorting into schooling based on unobserved components of gains.},

abstract = {In contexts ranging from public goods provision to information collection, a player's well-being depends on his or her own action as well as on the actions taken by his or her neighbours. We provide a framework to analyse such strategic interactions when neighbourhood structure, modelled in terms of an underlying network of connections, affects payoffs. In our framework, individuals are partially informed about the structure of the social network. The introduction of incomplete information allows us to provide general results characterizing how the network structure, an individual's position within the network, the nature of games (strategic substitutes vs. complements and positive vs. negative externalities) and the level of information shape individual behaviour and payoffs.},

It, then, turns out an agent who knows only the test by which she is going to be judged, but knows nothing about the data-generating process, is able to pass the test by generating forecasts strategically.The literature identifies a large number of tests that are vulnerable to strategic manipulation of uninformed forecasters, but also delivers some tests that cannot be passed without knowledge of the data-generating process. It also provides some results on philosophy of science and financial markets that are related to, and inspired by the results on testing experts.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

We select the best five survey questions for the module based on how strongly correlated they are with a "gold stan-dard" measure of women's agency. For a sample of 209 women in Haryana, India, we measure agency, first, through a semi-structured in-depth interview and, second, through a large set of close-ended questions. We use qualitative coding methods to score each woman's agency based on the interview, which we treat as her true agency. To identify the subset of close-ended questions most predictive of the "truth," we apply statistical methods similar to standard machine learning except that we specify how many survey questions are selected. The resulting 5-question index is as strongly correlated with the coded qualitative interview as is an index that uses all of the candidate questions. We also considered a second "gold standard" measure of agency, a real-stakes choice between money for oneself or one's husband. This lab game, however, did not measure agency cleanly in our setting. Thus, our preferred survey measure of agency is the one validated against qualitative interviews.},

First, to enhance productivity, invest in the institutional and information foundations to enable land and housing markets to function efficiently, while deregulating the intensity of land use in urban areas. This measure would require better coordination between planning for land use and planning for infrastructure, such that densification can be accompanied by infrastructure improvements. An incremental model of experimentation focusing on a few areas-say, around infrastructure corridors and neighborhoods-and then scaling up based on community-level consensus building can help in implementing densification reforms. Second, to improve livability, rationalize the rules of the game for delivering and expanding infrastructure services, such that providers can recover costs yet reach out to poorer neighborhoods and peripheral areas. Third, for better mobility, invest in improving connectivity between metropolitan cores and their peripheries, as these are the areas that will attract the bulk of people and businesses over the medium term. Connectivity improvements include investments in network infrastructure and logistics to facilitate movement of goods, while also easing mobility for people. Land policy, infrastructure services, and connectivity-coordinated improvements in this triad can help India reap dividends from improved spatial equity and greater economic efficiency that comes with urbanization.},

abstract = {Several scholars argue that high agricultural productivity can retard industrial development because it draws resources toward the comparative advantage sector, agriculture. However, agricultural productivity growth can increase savings and the supply of capital, generating an expansion of the capital-intensive sector, manufacturing. We highlight this mechanism in a simple model and test its predictions in the context of a large and exogenous increase in agricultural productivity due to the adoption of genetically engineered soy in Brazil. We find that agricultural productivity growth generated an increase in savings, but these were not reinvested locally. Instead, there were capital outflows from rural areas. Capital reallocated toward urban regions, where it was invested in the industrial and service sectors. The degree of financial integration affected the speed of structural transformation. Regions that were more financially integrated with soy-producing areas through bank branch networks experienced faster growth in nonagricultural lending. Within these regions, firms with preexisting relationships with banks receiving funds from the soy area experienced faster growth in borrowing and employment. JEL Codes: O14, O16, O41, F11.},

The increases examined in Kentucky and Michigan raised the benefit amount for high-earnings individuals by approximately 50 percent, while low-earnings individuals, who were unaffected by the benefit maximum, did not experience a change in their incentives. Time out of work increased for those eligible for the higher benefits and remained unchanged for those whose benefits were constant.

Prior work suggests two distinct mechanisms that have historically been difficult to differentiate: as a conduit of information, and as a source of social and economic support. We use a rich 'digital trace' dataset to link the migration decisions of millions of individuals to the topological structure of their social networks. We find that migrants systematically prefer 'interconnected' networks (where friends have common friends) to 'expansive' networks (where friends are well connected). A micro-founded model of network-based social capital helps explain this preference: migrants derive more utility from networks that are structured to facilitate social support than from networks that efficiently transmit information.

abstract = {This paper presents a semiparametric procedure to analyze the effects of institutional and labor market factors on recent changes in the U.S. distribution of wages. The effects of these factors are estimated by applying kernel density methods to appropriately weighted samples. The procedure provides a visually clear representation of where in the density of wages these various factors exert the greatest impact. Using data from the Current Population Survey, we find, as in previous research, that de-unionization and supply and demand shocks were important factors in explaining the rise in wage inequality from 1979 to 1988. We find also compelling visual and quantitative evidence that the decline in the real value of the minimum wage explains a substantial proportion of this increase in wage inequality, particularly for women. We conclude that labor market institutions are as important as supply and demand considerations in explaining changes in the U.S. distribution of wages from 1979 to 1988.},

abstract = {Mexican immigrants were historically clustered in a few cities, mainly in California and Texas. During the past 15 years, however, arrivals from Mexico established sizeable immigrant communities in many "new" cities. We explore the causes and consequences of the widening geographic diffusion of Mexican immigrants. A combination of demand-pull and supply push factors explains most of the inter-city variation in inflows of Mexican immigrants over the 1990s, and also illuminates the most important trend in the destination choices of new Mexican immigrants %u2013 the move away from Los Angeles. Mexican inflows raise the relative supply of low-education labor in a city, leading to the question of how cities adapt to these shifts. One mechanism, suggested by the Hecksher Olin model, is shifting industry composition. We find limited evidence of this mechanism: most of the increases in the relative supply of low-education labor are absorbed by changes in skill intensity within narrowly defined industries. Such adjustments could be readily explained if Mexican immigrant inflows had large effects on the relative wage structures of different cities. As has been found in previous studies of the local impacts of immigration, however, our analysis suggests that relative wage adjustments are small.

We then describe how the distribution of resources within and between neighborhoods has an impact on neighborhood health by linking neighborhood conditions to health outcomes such as obesity and cardiovascular disease. In this commentary, we also discuss the contributions of planning and zoning to environmental injustice and the production of riskscapes.

abstract = {In the regression-discontinuity (RD) design, units are assigned to treatment based on whether their value of an observed covariate exceeds a known cuto¤. In this design, local polynomial estimators are now routinely employed to construct con{\ldots}dence intervals for treatment e¤ects. The performance of these con{\ldots}dence intervals in applications, however, may be seriously hampered by their sensitivity to the speci{\ldots}c bandwidth employed. Available bandwidth selectors typically yield a “large”bandwidth, leading to data-driven con{\ldots}dence intervals that may be severely biased, with empirical coverage well below their nominal target. We propose new theory-based, more robust con{\ldots}dence interval estimators for average treatment e¤ects at the cuto¤ in sharp RD, sharp kink RD, fuzzy RD and fuzzy kink RD designs. Our proposed con{\ldots}dence intervals are constructed using a bias-corrected RD estimator together with a novel standard error estimator. For practical implementation, we discuss mean-square error optimal bandwidths, which are by construction not valid for conventional con{\ldots}dence intervals but valid with our robust approach, and consistent standard error estimators based on our new variance formulas. Among other possibilities, our results give formal justi{\ldots}cation to simple inference procedures based on increasing the order of the local polynomial estimators employed. We find in a simulation study that our con{\ldots}dence intervals exhibit close-to-correct empirical coverage and good empirical interval length on average, remarkably improving upon the alternatives available in the literature.

abstract = {When a researcher estimates the parameters of a regression function using information on all 50 states in the United States, or information on all visits to a website, what is the interpretation of the standard errors? Researchers typically report standard errors that are designed to capture sampling variation, based on viewing the data as a random sample drawn from a large population of interest, even in applications where it is difficult to articulate what that population of interest is and how it differs from the sample. In this paper we explore alternative interpretations for the uncertainty associated with regression estimates. As a leading example we focus on the case where some parameters of the regression function are intended to capture causal effects. We derive standard errors for causal effects using a generalization of randomization inference. Intuitively, these standard errors capture the fact that even if we observe outcomes for all units in the population of interest, there are for each unit missing potential outcomes for the treatment levels the unit was not exposed to. We show that our randomization-based standard errors in general are smaller than the conventional robust standard errors, and provide conditions under which they agree with them. More generally, correct statistical inference requires precise characterizations of the population of interest, the parameters that we aim to estimate within such population, and the sampling process. Estimation of causal parameters is one example where appropriate inferential methods may differ from conventional practice, but there are others.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends treating all school children at regular intervals with deworming drugs in areas where helminth infection is common. As the intervention is often claimed to have important health, nutrition, and societal effects beyond the removal of worms, we critically evaluated the evidence on benefits. OBJECTIVES To summarize the effects of giving deworming drugs to children to treat soil-transmitted helminths on weight, haemoglobin, and cognition; and the evidence of impact on physical well-being, school attendance, school performance, and mortality. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (14 April 2015); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), published in the Cochrane Library (2015, Issue 4); MEDLINE (2000 to 14 April 2015); EMBASE (2000 to 14 April 2015); LILACS (2000 to 14 April 2015); the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT); and reference lists, and registers of ongoing and completed trials up to 14 April 2015. SELECTION CRITERIA We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing deworming drugs for soil-transmitted helminths with placebo or no treatment in children aged 16 years or less, reporting on weight, haemoglobin, and formal tests of intellectual development. We also sought data on school attendance, school performance, and mortality. We included trials that combined health education with deworming programmes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS At least two review authors independently assessed the trials, evaluated risk of bias, and extracted data. We analysed continuous data using the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where data were missing, we contacted trial authors. We used outcomes at time of longest follow-up. The evidence quality was assessed using GRADE. This edition of the Cochrane Review adds the DEVTA trial from India, and draws on an independent analytical replication of a trial from Kenya. MAIN RESULTS We identified 45 trials, including nine cluster-RCTs, that met the inclusion criteria. One trial evaluating mortality included over one million children, and the remaining 44 trials included a total of 67,672 participants. Eight trials were in children known to be infected, and 37 trials were carried out in endemic areas, including areas of high (15 trials), moderate (12 trials), and low prevalence (10 trials). Treating children known to be infectedTreating children known to be infected with a single dose of deworming drugs (selected by screening, or living in areas where all children are infected) may increase weight gain over the next one to six months (627 participants, five trials, low quality evidence). The effect size varied across trials from an additional 0.2 kg gain to 1.3 kg. There is currently insufficient evidence to know whether treatment has additional effects on haemoglobin (247 participants, two trials, very low quality evidence); school attendance (0 trials); cognitive functioning (103 participants, two trials, very low quality evidence), or physical well-being (280 participants, three trials, very low quality evidence). Community deworming programmesTreating all children living in endemic areas with a dose of deworming drugs probably has little or no effect on average weight gain (MD 0.04 kg less, 95% CI 0.11 kg less to 0.04 kg more; trials 2719 participants, seven trials, moderate quality evidence), even in settings with high prevalence of infection (290 participants, two trials). A single dose also probably has no effect on average haemoglobin (MD 0.06 g/dL, 95% CI -0.05 lower to 0.17 higher; 1005 participants, three trials, moderate quality evidence), or average cognition (1361 participants, two trials, low quality evidence).Similiarly, regularly treating all children in endemic areas with deworming drugs, given every three to six months, may have little or no effect on average weight gain (MD 0.08 kg, 95% CI 0.11 kg less to 0.27 kg more; 38,392 participants, 10 trials, low quality evidence). The effects were variable across trials; one trial from a low prevalence setting carried out in 1995 found an increase in weight, but nine trials carried out since then found no effect, including five from moderate and high prevalence areas.There is also reasonable evidence that regular treatment probably has no effect on average height (MD 0.02 cm higher, 95% CI 0.14 lower to 0.17 cm higher; 7057 participants, seven trials, moderate quality evidence); average haemoglobin (MD 0.02 g/dL lower; 95% CI 0.08 g/dL lower to 0.04 g/dL higher; 3595 participants, seven trials, low quality evidence); formal tests of cognition (32,486 participants, five trials, moderate quality evidence); exam performance (32,659 participants, two trials, moderate quality evidence); or mortality (1,005,135 participants, three trials, low quality evidence). There is very limited evidence assessing an effect on school attendance and the findings are inconsistent, and at risk of bias (mean attendance 2% higher, 95% CI 4% lower to 8% higher; 20,243 participants, two trials, very low quality evidence).In a sensitivity analysis that only included trials with adequate allocation concealment, there was no evidence of any effect for the main outcomes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Treating children known to have worm infection may have some nutritional benefits for the individual. However, in mass treatment of all children in endemic areas, there is now substantial evidence that this does not improve average nutritional status, haemoglobin, cognition, school performance, or survival.},

abstract = {Rounding is the familiar practice of reporting one value whenever a real number lies in an interval. Uncertainty about the extent of rounding is common when researchers analyze survey responses to numerical questions. The prevalent practice has been to take numerical responses at face value, even though many may in fact be rounded. This paper studies the rounding of responses to survey questions that ask persons to state the percent-chance that some future event will occur. We analyze data from the Health and Retirement Study and find strong evidence of rounding, the extent of rounding differing across respondents. We propose use of a person's response pattern across different questions to infer his rounding practice, the result being interpretation of reported numerical values as interval data. We then bring to bear recent developments on statistical analysis of interval data to characterize the potential consequences of rounding for empirical research. Finally, we propose enrichment of surveys by probing to learn the extent and reasons for rounding.},

Backward sloping supply curves are commonly observed and they imply $\epsilon$ < 1. Our calculation of $\epsilon$ from estimates of supply curves by Ashenfelter and Heckman gives $\epsilon$ = 0.4. Optimum marginal rates decrease with $\epsilon$ when taxation is purely redistributive but may be nonmonotonic if positive revenue is to be raised. It is proved that optimum (linear or nonlinear) taxation involves a marginal rate of 100 percent when $\epsilon$ = 0. {\textcopyright} 1976.},

abstract = {To motivate fathers to take parental leave, several nations have reformed their leave programs to increase compensation and reserve some leave for fathers. Though takeup has increased, it is unclear whether fathers are responding to financial incentives or changed constraints or the 'daddy-only' labels. Moreover, although paternity leave may facilitate temporary changes in the division of household labor, little is known about whether these effects persist in later years. This paper examines these issues while studying the Quebec Parental Insurance Program (QPIP), a landmark reform to parental leave that increased benefits for all parents and reserved some weeks for fathers. I exploit plausibly exogenous program variation and data on benefit claims to first explore the short-run effects on leave behavior. Both regression discontinuity and difference-in-difference analyses suggest that QPIP increased fathers' participation rates by 250% and leave duration by 3 weeks. Further, the results strongly suggest that fathers responded to not only the higher benefits under QPIP but also the ‘daddy-only' label attached to the quota - a combination of these two factors caused a dramatic rise in men's participation in parental leave. This paper thus provides novel evidence that daddy quotas can have a powerful labeling effect when they are accompanied with increased benefits. Next, I investigate the long-term consequences on household dynamics by analyzing time-diary data and exploiting variation in exposure to QPIP across provinces, time and the age of one's children. This paper presents the first comprehensive evidence that exposure to paternity leave can have a large and persistent effect on the division of household labor: households exposed to QPIP are markedly less sex specialized in their time allocations and labor supply. Taken together, these results shed light on how leave schemes can be designed to induce fathers to participate, and they suggest that small changes in the initial parenting experience can have lasting effects on parents' behavior. In particular, they suggest that people respond to a combination of labels and financial incentives - and that behavior learned at the beginning of the parenthood experience tends to stick in later years. More broadly, my findings highlight that there need not be a trade-off between gender equality and parental time with children: paternity leave can distribute household responsibilities more equally and increase time investments in children.},

abstract = {This paper explores the incentives for backyarding, an expanding category of urban land-use in developing countries that has proliferated South Africa. The theoretical model exposes the trade-off faced by the homeowner in deciding how much backyard land to rent out: loss of yard space consumption in return for a gain in rental income. Under common forms for preferences, the homeowner's own-consumption of yard space falls as land rent increases, causing more land to be rented to backyarders. With better job access for backyarders raising land rent by increasing their willingness-to-pay, the analysis then predicts that the extent of backyarding will be higher for parcels with good job access. This hypothesis is tested by combining a satellite-based count of backyard dwellings per parcel with job-access data. The empirical results are consistent with the prediction that better job access increases the extent of backyarding.},

Exploiting differences in European mortality rates as an instrument for current institutions, we estimate large effects of institutions on income per capita. Once the effect of institutions is controlled for, countries in Africa or those closer to the equator do not have lower incomes. (JEL O11, P16, P51)},

This finding has shaped research agendas in a number of fields, including (but not limited to) macroeconomics, industrial organization, labor, and trade. This paper surveys and evaluates recent empirical work addressing the question of why businesses differ in their measured productivity levels. The causes are manifold, and differ depending on the particular setting. They include elements sourced in production practices—and therefore over which producers have some direct control, at least in theory—as well as from producers' external operating environments. After evaluating the current state of knowledge, I lay out what I see are the major questions that research in the area should address going forward.},

@article{Joe1989,
abstract = {There has been a lot of work on measures of dependence or association for bivariate probability distributions or bivariate data. These measures usually assume that the variables are both continuous or both categorical. In comparison, there is very little work on multivariate or conditional measures of dependence. The purpose of this article is to discuss measures of multivariate dependence and measures of conditional dependence based on relative entropies. These measures are conceptually very general, as they can be used for a set of variables that can be a mixture of continuous, ordinal-categorical, and nominal-categorical variables. For continuous or ordinal-categorical variables, a certain transformation of relative entropy to the interval [0, 1] leads to generalizations of the correlation, multiple-correlation, and partial-correlation coefficients. If all variables are nominal categorical, the relative entropies are standardized to take a maximum of 1 and then transformed so that in the bivariate case, there is a relative reduction in variability interpretation like that for the correlation coefficient. The relative entropy measures of dependence are compared with commonly used bivariate measures of association such as Kendall's $\tau$b and Goodman and Kruskal's $\lambda$ and with measures of dependence based on Pearson's ϕ2 distance. Examples suggest that these new measures of dependence should be useful additional summary values for nonmonotonic or nonlinear dependence. Assuming that the multivariate data are a random sample, the statistical measures of dependence with estimated probability density or mass functions can be studied asymptotically. Standard errors are obtained when all variables are categorical, and an outline of what must be done in the case of all continuous variables is given. {\textcopyright} 1989 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

The fact that urban charters are most effective for poor nonwhites and low-baseline achievers contributes to, but does not fully explain, these differences. We therefore link school-level charter impacts to school inputs and practices. The relative efficacy of urban lottery sample charters is accounted for by these schools' embrace of the No Excuses approach to urban education. In our Massachusetts sample, Non-No-Excuses urban charters are no more effective than nonurban charters. (JEL H75, I21, I28)},

abstract = {Starting in the late 1990s, China undertook a dramatic transformation of the large number of firms under state control. Small state-owned firms were privatized or closed. Large state-owned firms were corporatized and merged into large industrial groups under the control of the Chinese state. The state also created many new and large firms. We use detailed firm-level data to show that from 1998 to 2007, (i) state-owned firms that were closed were smaller and had low labor and capital productivity; (ii) the labor productivity of state-owned firms converged to that of private firms; (iii) the capital productivity of state-owned firms remained significantly lower than that of private firms; and (iv) total factor productivity (TFP) growth of state-owned firms was faster than that of private firms. We find the reforms of the state sector were responsible for 20 percent of aggregate TFP growth from 1998 to 2007.},

@article{Mogstad2020,
abstract = {Marginal treatment effect methods are widely used for causal inference and policy evaluation with instrumental variables. However, they fundamentally rely on the well-known monotonicity (threshold-crossing) condition on treatment choice behavior. Recent research has shown that this condition cannot hold with multiple instruments unless treatment choice is effectively homogeneous. Based on these findings, we develop a new marginal treatment effect framework under a weaker, partial monotonicity condition. The partial monotonicity condition is implied by standard choice theory and allows for rich heterogeneity even in the presence of multiple instruments. The new framework can be viewed as having multiple different choice models for the same observed treatment variable, all of which must be consistent with the data and with each other. Using this framework, we develop a methodology for partial identification of clearly stated, policy-relevant target parameters while allowing for a wide variety of nonparametric shape restrictions and parametric functional form assumptions. We show how the methodology can be used to combine multiple instruments together to yield more informative empirical conclusions than one would obtain by using each instrument separately. The methodology provides a blueprint for extracting and aggregating information about treatment effects from multiple controlled or natural experiments while still allowing for rich heterogeneity in both treatment effects and choice behavior.},

To gauge the magnitude of this influence, we evaluate the impact on schooling of reductions in IDD from intensive iodine supplementation in Tanzania. Our findings suggest a large effect of in utero iodine on cognition and human capital: treated children attain an estimated 0.35{\^{a}}•fi0.56 years of additional schooling relative to siblings and older and younger peers. Furthermore, the effect appears to be substantially larger for girls, consistent with laboratory evidence indicating greater cognitive sensitivity of female fetuses to maternal thyroid deprivation.

For countries with poor national income accounts, the optimal estimate of growth is a composite with roughly equal weights on conventionally measured growth and growth predicted from lights. Our estimates differ from official data by up to three percentage points annually. Using lights, empirical analyses of growth need no longer use countries as the unit of analysis; we can measure growth for sub- and supranational regions. We show, for example, that coastal areas in sub-Saharan Africa are growing slower than the hinterland. (JEL E01, E23, O11, 047, 057)},

@article{Cameron2004,
abstract = {"This paper measures the importance of borrowing constraints on education decisions. Empirical identification of borrowing constraints is secured by the economic prediction that opportunity costs and direct costs of schooling affect borrowing-constrained and unconstrained persons differently. Direct costs need to be financed during school and impose a larger burden on credit-constrained students. By contrast, gross forgone earnings do not have to be financed. We explore the implications of this idea using four methodologies: schooling attainment models, instrumental variable wage regressions, and two structural economic models that integrate both schooling choices and schooling returns into a unified framework. None of the methods produces evidence that borrowing constraints generate inefficiencies in the market for schooling in the current policy environment. We conclude that, on the margin, additional policies aimed at improving credit access will have little impact on schooling attainment."},

abstract = {In this paper I attempt to lay out the sources of conflict between the so-called “structural” and “experimentalist” camps in econometrics. Critics of the structural approach often assert that it produces results that rely on too many assumptions to be credible, and that the experimentalist approach provides an alternative that relies on fewer assumptions. Here, I argue that this is a false dichotomy. All econometric work relies heavily on a priori assumptions. The main difference between structural and experimental (or “atheoretic”) approaches is not in the number of assumptions but the extent to which they are made explicit.},

abstract = {The merits of alternative income tax policies depend on the population distri- bution of preferences for income and leisure. Standard theory, which supposes that persons want more income and more leisure, does not predict how they re- solve the tension between these desires. Empirical studies of labor supply have imposed strong preference assumptions that lack foundation. This paper exam- ines anew the problem of inference on income–leisure preferences and consid- ers the implications for evaluation of tax policy. I first perform a basic revealed- preference analysis assuming only that persons prefer more income and leisure. This shows that observation of a person's time allocation under a status quo tax policy may bound his allocation under a proposed policy or may have no implica- tions, depending on the tax schedules and the person's status quo time allocation. I next explore the identifying power of two classes of assumptions that restrict the distribution of income–leisure preferences. One assumes that groups of persons who face different choice sets have the same preference distribution. The second restricts the shape of this distribution. The generic finding is partial identification of preferences. This implies partial prediction of tax revenue under proposed poli- cies and partial knowledge of thewelfare function for utilitarian policy evaluation},

Both exercises show that developing countries with rigid employment laws tend to have larger informal sectors and higher unemployment, especially among young workers. A number of countries, especially in Eastern Europe and West Africa, have recently undergone significant reforms to make employment laws more flexible. Conversely, several countries in Latin America have made employment laws more rigid. These reforms are larger in magnitude than any reforms in developed countries and their study can produce new insights on the benefits of labor regulation.

We describe the methods we used in regression challenges, including our winning method for the Outaouais data set. We then turn our attention to the more general problem of scoring in probabilistic machine learning challenges. It is widely accepted that scoring rules should be proper in the sense that the true generative distribution has the best expected score; we note that while this is useful, it does not guarantee finding the best methods for practical machine learning tasks. We point out some problems in local scoring rules such as the negative logarithm of predictive density (NLPD), and illustrate with examples that many of these problems can be avoided by a distance-sensitive rule such as the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS).},

To examine this, we study an educational voucher programme in Colombia which allocated vouchers by lottery. Among voucher applicants to vocational schools, lottery winners were less likely to attend academic secondary schools and thus had peers with less desirable observable characteristics. Despite this, lottery winners had better educational outcomes. In this population, vouchers improved educational outcomes through channels beyond redistribution of desirable peers. We discuss potential channels which may explain the observed effects. {\textcopyright} The Author(s). Journal compilation {\textcopyright} Royal Economic Society 2010.},

abstract = {Estimation of average treatment effects under unconfounded or ignorable treatment assignment is often hampered by lack of overlap in the covariate distributions between treatment groups. This lack of overlap can lead to imprecise estimates, and can make commonly used estimators sensitive to the choice of specification. In such cases researchers have often used ad hoc methods for trimming the sample. We develop a systematic approach to addressing lack of overlap. We characterize optimal subsamples for which the average treatment effect can be estimated most precisely. Under some conditions, the optimal selection rules depend solely on the propensity score. For a wide range of distributions, a good approximation to the optimal rule is provided by the simple rule of thumb to discard all units with estimated propensity scores outside the range 0.1,0.9.},

@article{Anderson2007b,
abstract = {Payments between families at the time ofmarriage existed during the history of most developed countries and are currently pervasive in many areas of the developing world. These payments can be substantial enough to affect the welfare of women and a society's distribution of wealth. Recent estimates document transfers per marriage amounting to six times the annual household income in South Asia (Rao, 1993), and four times in sub-Saharan Africa (Dekker and Hoogeveen, 2002). This paper first establishes some basic facts about the prevalence and magni- tude of marriage payments. It then discusses how such patterns vary across coun- tries depending upon economic conditions, societal structures, institutions, and family characteristics. Such payments have also evolved within societies over time. For example, in some periods such payments have risen sharply. In some cases, payments have shifted from the grooms' sides to the brides', and vice versa. Also, property rights over such payments have sometimes shifted between marrying partners and parental generations. Economists, who have only recently begun to work on the topic, have focused on explaining these facts. The second part of the paper addresses this economic literature. Though considerable insight into many of the facts has been gained, many of the existing economic explanations are weakly convincing, and many puzzles remain. One crucial difficulty is that solid data in this field have been extremely rare. The descriptions of marriage payments in this paper are synthe- sized from a patchwork of studies across periods, places, and even epochs, and there are doubtless numerous cases which remain undocumented. Thus, the paper concludes with some conjectures along with suggestions for the type of data collection that will be needed to differentiate among them.},

abstract = {People spend most of their time at a few key locations, such as home and work. Being able to identify how the movements of people cluster around these important places is crucial for a range of technology and policy decisions in areas such as telecommunications and transportation infrastructure deployment. In this paper, we propose new techniques based on clustering and regression for analyzing anonymized cellular network data to identify generally important locations, and to discern semantically meaningful locations such as home and work. Starting with temporally sparse and spatially coarse location information, we propose a new algorithm to identify important locations. We test this algorithm on arbitrary cellphone users, including those with low call rates, and find that we are within 3 miles of ground truth for 88% of volunteer users. Further, after locating home and work, we achieve commute distance estimates that are within 1 mile of equivalent estimates derived from government census data. Finally, we perform carbon footprint analyses on hundreds of thousands of anonymous users as an example of how our data and algorithms can form an accurate and efficient underpinning for policy and infrastructure studies.},

abstract = {Traditional production function models rely on factor-neutral technology and functional form assumptions, such as Cobb-Douglas. These assumptions impose strong theoretical restrictions and are often rejected by the data. This paper develops a new method for estimating production functions with factor-augmenting technology and assesses its economic implications. The method does not impose parametric restrictions and generalizes prior approaches that rely on the CES production function. I first extend the canonical Olley-Pakes framework to accommodate factor-augmenting technology. Then, I show how to identify output elasticities based on a novel control variable approach and the optimality of input expenditures. I use this method to estimate output elasticities and markups in manufacturing industries in the US and four developing countries. Neglecting labor-augmenting productivity and imposing parametric restrictions mis-measures output elasticities and heterogeneity in the production function. My estimates suggest that standard models (i) underestimate capital elasticity by up to 70 percent (ii) overestimate labor elasticity by up to 80 percent. These biases propagate into markup estimates inferred from output elasticities: markups are overestimated by 20 percentage points. Finally, heterogeneity in output elasticities also affects estimated trends in markups: my estimates point to a much more muted markup growth (about half) in the US manufacturing sector than recent estimates.},

abstract = {Economists studying choice with partial knowledge typically assume that the decision maker places a subjective distribution on unknown quantities and maximizes expected utility. Someone lacking a subjective distribution faces a problem of choice under ambiguity. This article reviews recent research on policy choice under ambiguity, when the task is to choose treatments for a popu- lation. Ambiguity arises when a planner has partial knowledge of treatment response and does not feel able to place a subjective distribution on the unknowns. I first discuss dominance and alter- native criteria for choice among undominated policies. I then illustrate with the choice of a vaccination policy by a planner who has partial knowledge of the effect of vaccination on illness. I next study a class of problems in which a planner may want to cope with ambiguity by diversification, assigning observationally identi- cal persons to different treatments. Lastly, I consider a setting in which a planner should not diversify treatment.},

We estimate a rich model of college major choice using the belief data.

abstract = {Government policies that impose restrictions on the size of large establishments or firms, or promote small ones, are widespread across countries. In this paper, we develop a framework to systematically study policies of this class. We study a simple growth model with an endogenous size distribution of production units. We parameterize this model to account for the size distribution of establishments and for the large share of employment in large establishments. Then, we ask: quantitatively, how costly are policies that distort the size of production units? What is the impact of these policies on productivity measures, the equilibrium number of establishments and their size distribution? We find that these effects are potentially large: policies that reduce the average size of establishments by 20% lead to reductions in output and output per establishment up to 8.1% and 25.6% respectively, as well as large increases in the number of establishments (23.5%). ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Standard Bayesian methods are difficult to apply because restricted moment models do not imply fully specified likelihood functions. This paper proposes a Bayesian bootstrap approach to derive approx- imate posterior predictive distributions that are doubly robust for estimation of causal quantities. Simulations show that the approach performs well under various sources of misspecification of the outcome regression or propensity score models. The estimator is applied in a case study of the effect of area deprivation on the incidence of child pedestrian casualties in British cities. Keywords:},

abstract = {Estimates of road speeds have become commonplace and central to route planning, but few systems in production provide information about the reliability of the prediction. Probabilistic forecasts of travel time capture reliability and can be used for risk-averse routing, for reporting travel time reliability to a user, or as a component of fleet vehicle decision-support systems. Many of these uses (such as those for mapping services like Bing or Google Maps) require predictions for routes in the road network, at arbitrary times; the highest-volume source of data for this purpose is GPS data from mobile phones. We introduce a method (TRIP) to predict the probability distribution of travel time on an arbitrary route in a road network at an arbitrary time, using GPS data from mobile phones or other probe vehicles. TRIP captures weekly cycles in congestion levels, gives informed predictions for parts of the road network with little data, and is computationally efficient, even for very large road networks and datasets. We apply TRIP to predict travel time on the road network of the Seattle metropolitan region, based on large volumes of GPS data from Windows phones. TRIP provides improved interval predictions (forecast ranges for travel time) relative to Microsoft's engine for travel time prediction as used in Bing Maps. It also provides deterministic predictions that are as accurate as Bing Maps predictions, despite using fewer explanatory variables, and differing from the observed travel times by only 10.1% on average over 35,190 test trips. To our knowledge TRIP is the first method to provide accurate predictions of travel time reliability for complete, large-scale road networks.},

We use machine learning estimators for heterogeneous treatment effects to identify who benefits from an allocation. We then decompose the objective underlying the allocation into: differential (i) treatment effects, (ii) welfare weights between entities; and (iii) impact weights across outcomes. We apply this approach to Mexico's PROGRESA anti-poverty program, to estimate the preferences its allocation implies. The impacts of the program were heterogeneous, especially along income and age of household head. Controlling for these differential impacts, allocations are consistent with welfare weights that rank a household 13 percentiles higher if indigenous, 8 percentiles lower for each standard deviation increase in household income, and 21 percentiles higher for each additional small child in the household, on average. Allocations are consistent with valuing each missed school day and child sick day within conventional valuations, though our estimates are imprecise. Alternate eligibility criteria could have improved either average consumption, health or schooling outcomes.},

abstract = {We explore interval forecast comparison when the nominal confidence level is specified, but the quantiles on which intervals are based are not specified. It turns out that the problem is difficult, and perhaps unsolvable. We first consider a situation where intervals meet the Christoffersen conditions (in particular, where they are correctly calibrated), in which case the common prescription, which we rationalize and explore, is to prefer the interval of shortest length. We then allow for mis-calibrated intervals, in which case there is a calibration-length tradeoff. We propose two natural conditions that interval forecast loss functions should meet, and we show that a variety of popular approaches to interval forecast comparison fail them. Our negative results strengthen the case for abandoning interval forecasts in favor of density forecasts: Density forecasts not only provide richer information, but also can be readily compared using known proper scoring rules like the log predictive score, whereas interval forecasts cannot.},

We provide answers by aggregating evidence from existing experiments on performance pay that have both male and female subjects, regardless of whether they test for gender differences. We develop a Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) that allows us to estimate both the average effect and the heterogeneity across studies. We find that the gender response difference is close to zero and heterogeneity across studies is small. We also find that the average effect of performance pay is positive, increasing output by 0.28 standard deviations. The data are thus strongly supportive of agency theory for men and women alike.},

Even when peer monitoring is local, firms may achieve higher profits under collective reputation by decreasing the cost of maintaining customers' trust. The optimal number of firms that share a common reputation is greater when (1) trades are more frequent and public information is disseminated more rapidly, (2) the deviation gain is smaller compared to the quality premium, (3) customers' information regarding firms' quality is more precise, or (4) intragroup information about firms' quality is more global. From a positive perspective, we suggest how social norms can influence the reputation of regional products. We also offer an efficiency explanation for food scares. From a normative point of view, in our model, protection of geographical indications increases and mandatory traceability decreases welfare and incentives to provide quality without taking into account direct implementation costs. {\textcopyright} The Author (2012).

I use projects that were planned and approved, but never actually built, to deal with non-random placement of housing projects. Government housing has a significant positive effect on household earnings. This is driven primarily by increases in earnings for women. I present evidence consistent with a mechanism whereby formal housing frees up time by alleviating the demands of work in the home.},

abstract = {Nominal wages differ widely across space. Do these differences imply large produc-tivity benefits to moving people across space, or are the differences driven by selec-tion? To answer this question, we construct a general spatial equilibrium framework. Our framework allows us to decompose observed wage differences into four compo-nents: i) selection due to comparative advantage, ii) wedges due to migration costs, iii) endogenous amenity differences, and iv) endogenous agglomeration benefits. We show how migration costs can lead to lower aggregate productivity by hindering the movement of labor to where it is most productive. We then estimate the model using detailed micro data for Indonesia and the United States. Two counterfactuals illus-trate the quantitative implications of migration costs on aggregate productivity. First, we estimate that between 1976 and 2011 migration costs declined by 21% in Indone-sia; the improved allocation of labor to where it is most productive explains a 37% increase in Indonesia's GDP growth over this period. Second, we estimate that migra-tion costs in the United States are 60% smaller than in Indonesia; higher costs of labor movement in Indonesia explain 4% of the GDP per-capita gap between the United States and Indonesia.},

An imbalance occurs when one or more classes have very low proportions in the training data as compared to the other classes. Imbalance can be present in any data set or application, and hence, the practitioner should be aware of the implications of modeling this type of data. To illustrate the impacts and remedies for severe class imbalance, we present a case study example (Section 16.1) and the impact of class imbalance on performances measures (Section 16.2). Sections 16.3-16.6 describe approaches for handling imbalance using the existing data such as maximizing minority class accuracy, adjusting classification cut-offs or prior probabilities, or adjusting sample weights prior to model tuning. Handling imbalance can also be done through sophisticated up- or down-sampling methods (Section 16.7) or by applying costs to the classification errors (Section 16.8). In the Computing Section (16.9) we demonstrate how to implement these remedies in R. Finally, exercises are provided at the end of the chapter to solidify the concepts.},

abstract = {Deployment of larger scale wind turbine systems, particularly offshore, requires more organized operation and maintenance strategies to ensure systems are safe, profitable and cost-effective. Among existing maintenance strategies, reliability centred maintenance is regarded as best for offshore wind turbines, delivering corrective and proactive (i.e. preventive and predictive) maintenance techniques enabling wind turbines to achieve high availability and low cost of energy. Reliability centred maintenance analysis may demonstrate that an accurate and reliable condition monitoring system is one method to increase availability and decrease the cost of energy from wind. In recent years, efforts have been made to develop efficient and cost-effective condition monitoring techniques for wind turbines. A number of commercial wind turbine monitoring systems are available in the market, most based on existing techniques from other rotating machine industries. Other wind turbine condition monitoring reviews have been published but have not addressed the technical and commercial challenges, in particular, reliability and value for money. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap and present the wind industry with a detailed analysis of the current practical challenges with existing wind turbine condition monitoring technology.},

abstract = {This paper reconciles the asymptotic disagreement between Bayesian and frequentist inference in set‐identified models by adopting a multiple‐prior (robust) Bayesian approach. We propose new tools for Bayesian inference in set‐identified models and show that they have a well‐defined posterior interpretation in finite samples and are asymptotically valid from the frequentist perspective. The main idea is to construct a prior class that removes the source of the disagreement: the need to specify an unrevisable prior for the structural parameter given the reduced‐form parameter. The corresponding class of posteriors can be summarized by reporting the ‘posterior lower and upper probabilities' of a given event and/or the ‘set of posterior means' and the associated ‘robust credible region'. We show that the set of posterior means is a consistent estimator of the true identified set and the robust credible region has the correct frequentist asymptotic coverage for the true identified set if it is convex. Otherwise, the method provides posterior inference about the convex hull of the identified set. For impulse‐response analysis in set‐identified Structural Vector Autoregressions, the new tools can be used to overcome or quantify the sensitivity of standard Bayesian inference to the choice of an unrevisable prior.},

abstract = {This paper combines national accounts, survey, wealth and fiscal data (including recently released tax data on high-income taxpayers) in order to provide consistent series on the accumulation and distribution of income and wealth in China over the 1978-2015 period. We find that the aggregate national wealth-income ratio has increased, from 350% in 1978 to almost 700% in 2015. This can be accounted for by a combination of high saving and investment rates and a gradual rise in relative asset prices, reflecting changes in the legal system of property. The share of public property in national wealth has declined from about 70% in 1978 to less than 35% in 2015, which is still a lot higher than in rich countries (close to 0% or negative). Next, we provide sharp upward revision of official inequality estimates. The top 10% income share rose from 26% to 41% of national income between 1978 and 2015, while the bottom 50% share dropped from 28% to 15%. China's inequality levels used to be close to Nordic countries, and are now approaching U.S. levels.},

abstract = {Controversy over labor market policy often centers on achieving a balance between preventing worker exploitation, and avoiding loss of productivity or employment through excessive regulation. Although the literature documenting the impact of labor market regulation on employment is extensive, there is a dearth of evidence on the impact of such policies in low-income countries (LICs). Since it is easier for workers, especially women, to slip into the informal sector in LICs, regulations are likely to have stronger impacts on formal employment in these countries (but lower impacts on unemployment). We systematically reviewed available research from countries that are, or were until recently, LICs. Most studies document that more stringent labor regulations are associated with lower formal sector employment and higher informal sector employment. We also conducted a metaregression analysis of the impact of minimum wages on formal and informal employment. After controlling for publication bias, higher minimum wages are associated with lower formal employment and a higher share of informal workers. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Corruption in hiring for public sector jobs is common in developing countries, and has been assumed to have a detrimental effect on delivery of government services. This paper provides a framework for understanding this type of corruption and demonstrates that it need not have negative consequences. I collect original data from a hiring process for managerial positions in a developing country health bureaucracy, and find that hires paid large bribes, averaging 17 months' salary. I use data on bribe offers to characterize the structure of these markets, showing that job allocations are made as if via a first-price, winner-pay, sealed bid auction. To establish the conse-quences of corruption, I estimate a structural model of entry to determine hires under counterfactual hiring procedures, such as standardized testing, and compare them to actual hires. For this com-parison, I identify causal relationships between a set of hire characteristics and better delivery of health services. Based on these characteristics, actual hires are of comparable or superior quality to the hires under counterfactual systems, e.g. as compared to hires under a knowledge-based test, actual hires are 4.3-8.7 percentage points closer to the predicted optimal set of hires. Although hiring decisions are based primarily on bribes, hires are high quality because applicant wealth and willingness to pay for the position are strongly positively correlated with quality. Applying this to a general model of hiring, I identify the environments in which corruption will lead to misallocation, discuss how anti-corruption efforts should be designed, and argue for a greater focus on hiring for mid-level government managers.},

However, there is significant evidence of substitution from other forms of wealth in the upper tail of the distribution.},

abstract = {Consider a planner choosing treatments for observationally identical persons who vary in their response to treatment. There are two treatments with binary outcomes. One is a status quo with known population success rate. The other is an innovation for which the data are the outcomes of an experiment. Karlin and Rubin [1956. The theory of decision procedures for distributions with monotone likelihood ratio. Ann. Math. Statist. 27, 272-299] assumed that the objective is to maximize the population success rate and showed that the admissible rules are the KR-monotone rules. These assign everyone to the status quo if the number of experimental successes is below a specified threshold and everyone to the innovation if experimental success exceeds the threshold. We assume that the objective is to maximize a concave-monotone function f ({\textperiodcentered}) of the success rate and show that admissibility depends on the curvature of f ({\textperiodcentered}). Let a fractional monotone rule be one where the fraction of persons assigned to the innovation weakly increases with the number of experimental successes. We show that the class of fractional monotone rules is complete if f ({\textperiodcentered}) is concave and strictly monotone. Define an M-step monotone rule to be a fractional monotone rule with an interior fractional treatment assignment for no more than M consecutive values of the number of experimental successes. The M-step monotone rules form a complete class if f ({\textperiodcentered}) is differentiable and has sufficiently weak curvature. Bayes rules and the minimax-regret rule depend on the curvature of the welfare function. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Nishida2013,
abstract = {Reallocation growth occurs when an input moves from a lower marginal product to a higher marginal product activity. Three recent studies use two distinct methodologies to examine the sources of the strong surge in aggregate productivity growth (APG) in India�s manufacturing sector since 1990 following significant economic reforms. They all conclude that APG was primarily driven by within-plant increases in technical efficiency and not between-plant reallocation of inputs. Given the nature of the reforms, where many barriers to input reallocation were removed, this finding has surprised researchers and been dubbed �India�s Mysterious Manufacturing Miracle.� In this paper we show that these findings may be an artifact of the way the studies estimate reallocation. One approach counts all reallocation growth arising from the movement of intermediate inputs as technical efficiency growth. The second approach introduces measurement error into estimated reallocation by using plant-level average products - total factor productivity residuals - as a proxy for marginal products, which could be problematic as economic theory suggests that average products and marginal products are unrelated in equilibrium. Using microdata on manufacturing from 4 countries � the U.S., Chile, Colombia, and Slovenia � we show that both approaches significantly understate the true role of reallocation in economic growth. In the U.S. almost 50% of reallocation growth is due to movements of intermediate inputs, meaning if India is similar to the U.S. then reallocation�s share of total Indian manufacturing APG since 1990 increases from the previous estimate of one-third to almost two-thirds.},

abstract = {India's dysfunctional electricity sector is widely viewed as a constraint on growth and social welfare. In 2003, the Indian government instituted market-oriented reforms that opened access to the power grid and established exchanges for power trade. I use confidential data on hourly bids and offers to study the competitiveness of the resulting wholesale power market, in which tight constraints on transmission may limit competition across regions of the country. I estimate firm marginal costs from supply offers using first-order conditions for optimal bidding that account for the likelihood that transmission constraints will cut off demand and competing supply from other regions. Using these cost estimates, I run counterfactual simulations to measure the surplus gains from increasing transmission ca- pacity. I find that relaxing import constraints into the two most constrained regions would increase total market surplus by 19 percent or USD 110 million per year. The strategic response of suppliers to transmission expansions accounts for 72 percent of this gain, indi- cating that new transmission greatly undercuts local market power. The marginal benefits of capacity expansion into the two most constrained regions exceed the marginal costs of investment by factors of 1.63 and 3.50, respectively. Liberalization in electricity genera- tion requires that the government take a strong complementary role through regulation and infrastructure investment to ensure competition.},

abstract = {A major determinant of input subsidy programs' effects on the achievement of national policy goals is the extent to which they raise total fertilizer use. This study synthesizes recent literature on how the new generation of targeted input subsidy programs has affected national fertilizer use after accounting for crowding effects, and derives benefit–cost (BC) estimates of the fertilizer subsidy programs for Kenya, Malawi, and Zambia after accounting for crowding out and diversion. We highlight two major findings. First, accounting for the illicit diversion of program fertilizer can profoundly influence estimates of how fertilizer subsidy programs affect total fertilizer use and program impacts. Given recent evidence that 33% or more of total program fertilizer may be diverted before being received by intended beneficiary farmers, the failure to account for program diversion is shown to overestimate the contribution of the subsidy programs to national fertilizer use by 67.3% in the case of Malawi, by 61.6% for Zambia, and by 138.0% for Kenya. The second major finding is that the incremental value of maize output produced from these subsidy programs is considerably less than their costs in most years, except under unusually high maize price assumptions. Conventional BC analyses that do not account for crowding out and diversion may seriously overestimate the benefits of input subsidy programs. Greater attention to program design and implementation details to reduce problems of crowding out and diversion can substantially raise the returns to such programs.},

@article{Abadie2017b,
abstract = {In empirical work in economics it is common to report standard errors that account for clustering of units. Typically, the motivation given for the clustering adjustments is that unobserved components in outcomes for units within clusters are correlated. However, because correlation may occur across more than one dimension, this motivation makes it difficult to justify why researchers use clustering in some dimensions, such as geographic, but not others, such as age cohorts or gender. It also makes it difficult to explain why one should not cluster with data from a randomized experiment. In this paper, we argue that clustering is in essence a design problem, either a sampling design or an experimental design issue. It is a sampling design issue if sampling follows a two stage process where in the first stage, a subset of clusters were sampled randomly from a population of clusters, while in the second stage, units were sampled randomly from the sampled clusters. In this case the clustering adjustment is justified by the fact that there are clusters in the population that we do not see in the sample. Clustering is an experimental design issue if the assignment is correlated within the clusters. We take the view that this second perspective best fits the typical setting in economics where clustering adjustments are used. This perspective allows us to shed new light on three questions: (i) when should one adjust the standard errors for clustering, (ii) when is the conventional adjustment for clustering appropriate, and (iii) when does the conventional adjustment of the standard errors matter.},

The integration of immigrants and their children contributes to our economic vitality and our vibrant and ever changing culture. We have offered opportunities to immigrants and their children to better themselves and to be fully incorporated into our society and in exchange immigrants have become Americans - embracing an American identity and citizenship, protecting our country through service in our military, fostering technological innovation, harvesting its crops, and enriching everything from the nation's cuisine to its universities, music, and art. Today, the 41 million immigrants in the United States represent 13.1 percent of the U.S. population. The U.S.-born children of immigrants, the second generation, represent another 37.1 million people, or 12 percent of the population. Thus, together the first and second generations account for one out of four members of the U.S. population. Whether they are successfully integrating is therefore a pressing and important question. Are new immigrants and their children being well integrated into American society, within and across generations? Do current policies and practices facilitate their integration? How is American society being transformed by the millions of immigrants who have arrived in recent decades? To answer these questions, this new report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine summarizes what we know about how immigrants and their descendants are integrating into American society in a range of areas such as education, occupations, health, and language.},

We develop a loss minimization approach that quantifies bounds on the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) when unobserved confounder have a bounded effect on the odds of treatment selection. Our approach is scalable and allows flexible use of model classes, including nonparametric and black-box machine learning methods. Using these bounds, we propose a related sensitivity analysis for the average treatment effect (ATE), and develop a semi-parametric framework that extends/bounds the augmented inverse propensity weighted (AIPW) estimator for the ATE beyond the assumption that all confounders are observed. By constructing a Neyman orthogonal score, our estimator is a regular root-n estimator so long as the nuisance parameters can be estimated at the $o_p(n^{-1/4})$ rate. We complement our methodological development with optimality results showing that our proposed bounds are tight in certain cases. We demonstrate our method on simulated and real data examples, and show accurate coverage of our confidence intervals in practical finite sample regimes.},

abstract = {Bayesian hierarchical models serve as a standard methodology for aggregation and synthesis of data from heterogeneous settings, used widely in statistics and other disciplines. I apply this framework to aggregate the evidence from 7 randomised experiments of expanding access to microcredit, to assess both the general impact of the intervention and the heterogeneity across contexts. The evidence suggests that the general impact of microcredit access on household profits is likely to be small, with an effect of zero well within the 95% posterior credible interval in all specifications. Standard pooling metrics for the studies indicate 49-81% pooling on the treatment effects, suggesting that the site-specific effects are reasonably informative and externally valid for each other and for the general case. Further analysis incorporating household covariates shows that the cross-study heterogeneity is almost entirely generated by heterogeneous effects for the 27% households who previously operated businesses before microcredit expansion. A cautious assessment of the correlations between site-specific covariates and treatment effects using a Bayesian Ridge procedure indicates that the interest rate on the microloans has the strongest correlation with the treatment effects.},

abstract = {We show that the distributions of random coefficients in various discrete choice models are nonparametrically identified. Our identification results apply to static discrete choice models including binary logit, multinomial logit, nested logit, and probit models as well as to dynamic programming discrete choice models. In these models the only key condition we need to verify for identification is that the type specific model choice probability belongs to a class of functions that include analytic functions. Therefore our identification results are general enough to include most of commonly used discrete choice models in the literature. Our identification argument builds on insights from nonparametric specification testing. We find that the role of analytic function in our identification results is to effectively remove the full support requirement often exploited in other identification approaches.},

Country-level “macro” measures of the quality of policies and institutions are strongly correlated with project outcomes, consistent with the view that country-level performance matters for aid effectiveness. However, a striking feature of the data is that the success of individual development projects varies much more within countries than it does between countries. A large set of project-level “micro” variables, including project size, project length, the effort devoted to project preparation and supervision, and early-warning indicators that flag problematic projects during the implementation stage, accounts for some of this within-country variation in project outcomes. Measures of World Bank project manager quality also matter significantly for the ultimate project outcomes. We discuss the implications of these findings for donor policies aimed at aid effectiveness.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Increasing educational attainment around the world is one of the key aims of the Millennium Development Goals. Cash transfer programs, both conditional and unconditional, are a popular social protection tool in developing countries that aim, among other things, to improve education outcomes in developing countries. The debate over whether these programs should include conditions has been at the forefront of recent global policy discussions. This systematic review aims to complement the existing evidence on the effectiveness of these programs in improving schooling outcomes and help inform the debate surrounding the design of cash transfer programs. OBJECTIVES Our main objective was to assess the relative effectiveness of conditional and unconditional cash transfers in improving enrollment, attendance and test scores in developing countries. Our secondary objective was to understand the role of different dimensions of the cash transfer programs, particularly the role of the intensity of conditions and the effects of priming (with respect to the importance of children's schooling) in cash transfer programs. SEARCH STRATEGY Five main strategies were used to identify relevant reports: (1) Electronic searches of 37 international databases (concluded on 18 April 2012), (2) contacted researchers working in the area, (3) hand searched key journals, (4) reviewed websites of relevant organizations, and (5) given the year delay between the original search and the final edits of the review we updated our references with all new eligible references the study team was aware of as of 30 April 2013. SELECTION CRITERIA To be eligible for this review, studies had to either assess the impact of a conditional cash transfer program (CCT), with at least one condition explicitly related to schooling, or evaluate an unconditional cash transfer program (UCT). The report had to include at least one quantifiable measure of enrollment, attendance or test scores. The report had to be published after 1997, utilize a randomized control trial or a quasi-experimental design, and take place in a developing country. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS A data extraction sheet was constructed to collect data on impacts and characteristics of the report and intervention. Enrollment and attendance were coded using odds ratios, while test scores were coded using standardized mean differences. Effect sizes were synthesized and summarized within and across reports to one effect size per outcome for each study. Given the heterogeneity of true effects in the population, analyses of effect sizes were estimated using random effects models. Moderator analysis was conducted with six additional variables. RESULTS The sample includes 75 reports, with data from 35 studies, including five UCTs, 26 CCTs, and four studies that directly compare CCTs to UCTs. Our findings suggest that both CCTs (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.41, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.27-1.56) and UCTs (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.08-1.41) have a significant effect on enrollment. These results indicate that CCTs increase the odds of a child being enrolled in school by 41% and UCTs increase the odds by 23%. We do not find a significant difference when comparing CCTs to UCTs (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.94-1.42]. The binary categorization of these programs into CCT vs. UCT ignores the fact that there is a great deal of variation in the intensity of the conditionality. If we instead group the conditionality variable into three broader categories (i) no schooling conditions (intensity=1 or 2), (ii) some schooling conditions with no enforcement or monitoring (intensity=3 or 4) and (iii) explicit schooling conditions monitored and enforced (intensity=5 or 6) we find odds ratios as follows: 1.18 (95% CI 1.05-1.33), 1.25 (95% CI 1.10-1.42), and 1.60 (95% 1.37-1.88), respectively. The 95% CI for studies with no conditions and studies with conditions monitored and enforced do not overlap. Meta-regression indicates that outside of the intensity of the conditions imposed, none of the other measured design elements have a significant effect on moderating the overall effect size. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Our main finding is that both CCTs and UCTs improve the odds of being enrolled in and attending school compared to no cash transfer program. The effect sizes for enrollment and attendance are always larger for CCT programs compared to UCT programs but the difference is not significant. When programs are categorized as having no schooling conditions, having some conditions with minimal monitoring and enforcement, and having explicit conditions that are monitored and enforced, a much clearer pattern emerges. While interventions with no conditions or some conditions that are not monitored have some effect on enrollment rates (18-25% improvement in odds of being enrolled in school), programs that are explicitly conditional, monitor compliance and penalize non-compliance have substantively larger effects (60% improvement in odds of enrollment). Unlike enrollment and attendance, the effectiveness of cash transfer programs on improving test scores is small at best. More research is needed that looks at longer term outcomes such as test scores, as well as on evaluating UCTs more generally.},

While standard randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are internally consistent, the unobservability of effort compromises external validity. We approach trial design as a principal-agent problem and show that natural extensions of RCTs—which we call selective trials—can help improve external validity. In particular, selective trials can disentangle the effects of treatment, effort, and the interaction of treatment and effort. Moreover, they can help identify when treatment effects are affected by erroneous beliefs and inappropriate effort expenditure.(JEL C90, D82)},

abstract = {We estimate the causal effect of each county in the United States on children's incomes in adulthood. We first estimate a fixed effects model that is identified by analyzing families who move across counties with children of different ages. We then use these fixed effect estimates to (i) quantify how much places matter for intergenerational mobility, (ii) construct forecasts of the causal effect of growing up in each county that can be used to guide families seeking to move to opportunity, and (iii) characterize which types of areas produce better outcomes. For children growing up in low-income families, each year of childhood exposure to a one standard deviation (std. dev.) better county increases income in adulthood by 0.5%. There is substantial variation in counties' causal effects even within metro areas. Counties with less concentrated poverty, less income inequality, better schools, a larger share of two-parent families, and lower crime rates tend to produce better outcomes for children in poor families. Boys' outcomes varymore across areas than girls' outcomes, and boys have especially negative outcomes in highly segregated areas. Areas that generate better outcomes have higher house prices on average, but our approach uncovers many "opportunity bargains"-places that generate good outcomes but are not very expensive.},

abstract = {Imagine a nefarious researcher in economics who is only interested in finding a statistically significant result of an experiment. The researcher has 100 different variables he could examine, and the truth is that the experiment has no impact. By construction, the researcher should find an average of five of these variables statistically significantly different between the treatment group and the control group at the 5 percent level—after all, the exact definition of 5 percent significance implies that there will be a 5 percent false rejection rate of the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the groups. The nefarious researcher, who is interested only in showing that this experiment has an effect, chooses to report only the results on the five variables that pass the statistically significant threshold. If the researcher is interested in a particular sign of the result—that is, showing that this program “works” or “doesn't work”— on average half of these results will go in the direction the researcher wants. Thus, if a researcher can discard or not report all the variables that do not agree with his desired outcome, the researcher is virtually guaranteed a few positive and statistically significant results, even if in fact the experiment has no effect.},

@article{Cattaneo2015b,
abstract = {In the Regression Discontinuity (RD) design, units are assigned a treatment based on whether their value of an observed covariate is above or below a fixed cutoff. Under the assumption that the distribution of potential confounders changes continuously around the cutoff, the discontinuous jump in the probability of treatment assignment can be used to identify the treatment effect. Although a recent strand of the RD literature advocates interpreting this design as a local randomized experiment, the standard approach to estimation and inference is based solely on continuity assump- tions that do not justify this interpretation. In this article, we provide precise condi- tions in a randomization-inference context under which this interpretation is directly justified, and develop exact finite-sample inference procedures based on them. Our randomization-inference framework is motivated by the observation that only a few observations might be available close enough to the threshold where local random- ization is plausible, and hence standard large-sample procedures may be suspect. Our proposed methodology is intended as a complement and a robustness check to standard RD inference approaches. We illustrate our framework with a study of two measures of party-level advantage in the U.S. Senate, where the number of close races is small and our framework is well suited for analysis. Our methodology offers support to results obtained from standard RD methods in one case but not the other.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. We investigate the regulation of labor markets through employment, collec tive relations, and social security laws in 85 countries. We find that the political power of the left is associated with more stringent labor regulations and more generous social security systems, and that socialist, French, and Scandinavian legal origin countries have sharply higher levels of labor regulation than do common law countries. However, the effects of legal origins are larger, and explain more ofthe variation in regulations, than those of politics. Heavier regulation of labor is associated with lower labor force participation and higher unemployment, especially of the young. These results are most naturally consistent with legal theories, according to which countries have pervasive regulatory styles inherited from the transplantation of legal systems.},

This paper introduces a new class of confidence sets and tests based on generalized moment selection (GMS). GMS procedures are shown to have correct asymptotic size in a uniform sense and are shown not to be asymptotically conservative. The power of GMS tests is compared to that of subsampling, m out of n bootstrap, and " plug-in asymptotic " (PA) tests. The latter three procedures are the only general procedures in the literature that have been shown to have correct asymptotic size (in a uniform sense) for the moment inequality/equality model. GMS tests are shown to have asymptotic power that dominates that of subsampling, m out of n bootstrap, and PA tests. Subsampling and m out of n bootstrap tests are shown to have asymptotic power that dominates that of PA tests.

For example, the substitution of a squared return for the conditional variance in the evaluation of ARCH-type models can result in an inferior model being chosen as 'best' with a probability that converges to one as the sample size increases. We document the practical relevance of this problem in an empirical application and by simulation experiments. Our results provide an additional argument for using the realized variance in out-of-sample evaluations rather than the squared return. We derive the theoretical results in a general framework that is not specific to the comparison of volatility models. Similar problems can arise in comparisons of forecasting models whenever the predicted variable is a latent variable. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Simple approaches that form the elementary building blocks of more advanced approaches are discussed first. Then, special attention is devoted to covering methods that rely on readily available auxiliary variables (such as repeated measurements or indicators or instrumental variables). Results relaxing most of the commonly invoked simplifying assumptions are presented (linear measurement structure, independent errors, zero-mean errors, availability of auxiliary information).

abstract = {The high rate of global urbanization has resulted in a rapid increase in informal settlements, which can be defined as unplanned, unauthorized, and/or unstructured housing. Techniques for efficiently mapping these settlement boundaries can benefit various decision making bodies. From a remote sensing perspective, informal settlements share unique spatial characteristics that distinguish them from other types of structures (e. g., industrial, commercial, and formal residential). These spatial characteristics are often captured in high spatial resolution satellite imagery. We analyzed the role of spatial, structural, and contextual features (e. g., GLCM, Histogram of Oriented Gradients, Line Support Regions, Lacunarity) for urban neighborhood mapping, and computed several low-level image features at multiple scales to characterize local neighborhoods. The decision parameters to classify formal-, informal-, and non-settlement classes were learned under Decision Trees and a supervised classification framework. Experiments were conducted on high-resolution satellite imagery from the CitySphere collection, and four different cities (i.e., Caracas, Kabul, Kandahar, and La Paz) with varying spatial characteristics were represented. Overall accuracy ranged from 85% in La Paz, Bolivia, to 92% in Kandahar, Afghanistan. While the disparities between formal and informal neighborhoods varied greatly, many of the image statistics tested proved robust.},

@article{Arai2015a,
abstract = {The understanding of mass population movements has greatly advanced with the rapid spread of ubiquitous devices. Anonymized call detail records (CDRs) for mobile phones have enabled us to not only trace individual trajectories but also approximate activity patterns, including significant locations such as homes and workplaces. The majority of studies analyzing CDRs attempt to utilize the mobility patterns of anonymized crowds to improve transportation and public health. This is quite reasonable because CDRs can capture the movements of people at given times and places, whereas general statistics usually account for a population based on their locations of residence. However, it has also been pointed out that there are discrepancies between the movements of people as observed through CDRs and those of an entire population in a given area. This is because CDRs only represent device users. In fact, we can never learn about the population that is unobservable through CDRs only by analyzing CDRs. Therefore, this study attempts to provide clues to help us understand the whereabouts of the unobservable population by analyzing two months of the CDRs for 58 volunteers with mobile device service from a major telecommunications company in combination with field survey data from Dhaka. We surveyed the personal and household attributes of mobile users in relation to their calling behavior. The analysis results show that per mobile user observed in CDRs, there is an average of roughly 2.4 to 2.8 unobservable people. Their age groups and gender composition are also provided. We find that male and female users exhibit opposite trends in call locations according to the presence of children within the household. In addition, based on field observations, we find that the location and time distributions of small children follow some specific routines. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the whereabouts of the unobservable population, the majority of whom are children and a- e considered to be vulnerable to disasters or infectious diseases but are difficult to locate through CDRs alone.},

abstract = {We use the exchange between Kearney/Levine and Jaeger/Joyce/Kaestner on 16 and Pregnant to reexamine the use of DiD as a response to the failure of nature to properly design an experiment for us. We argue that (1) any DiD paper should address why the original levels of the experimental and control groups differed, and why this would not impact trends, (2) the parallel trends argument requires a justification of the chosen functional form and that the use of the interaction coefficients in probit and logit may be justified in some cases, and (3) parallel trends in the period prior to treatment is suggestive of counterfactual parallel trends, but parallel pre-trends is neither necessary nor sufficient for the parallel counterfactual trends condition to hold. Importantly, the purely statistical approach uses pretesting and thus, generates the wrong standard errors. Moreover, we underline the dangers of implicitly or explicitly accepting the null hypothesis when failing to reject the absence of a differential pre-trend.},

abstract = {An individual who takes an HIV test can be informed about their own status and risk. Similarly, when friends, family or neighbors learn of a person's HIV status, they may update their beliefs about HIV infection among people they know. Using an experiment conducted in rural Malawi which randomly assigned incentives to learn HIV results, we find that as people in the community learn their HIV results, individuals revise their beliefs downward about deaths attributable to HIV/AIDS. We find corresponding behavioral responses with a significant decrease in condom use and no significant increase in multiple partnerships among those who are HIV-negative. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@article{Stoye2020,
abstract = {This paper revisits the simple, but empirically salient, problem of inference on a real-valued parameter that is partially identified through upper and lower bounds with asymptotically normal estimators. A simple confidence interval is proposed and is shown to have the following properties: - It is never empty or awkwardly short, including when the sample analog of the identified set is empty. - It is valid for a well-defined pseudotrue parameter whether or not the model is well-specified. - It involves no tuning parameters and minimal computation. In general, computing the interval requires concentrating out one scalar nuisance parameter. For uncorrelated estimators of bounds --notably if bounds are estimated from distinct subsamples-- and conventional coverage levels, this step can be skipped. The proposed $95\%$ confidence interval then simplifies to the union of a simple $90\%$ (!) confidence interval for the partially identified parameter and an equally simple $95\%$ confidence interval for a point-identified pseudotrue parameter. This case obtains in the motivating empirical application, in which improvement over existing inference methods is demonstrated. More generally, simulations suggest excellent length and size control properties.},

In using a nationally representative data set, propensity score methods are employed to reduce selection bias. This paper finds that given the observed household characteristics adjusted by propensity scores, slum notification will increase the average amount of money spent on housing construction, though the proportion of households who would improve their houses is estimated to be higher in non-formalized settlements. The findings suggest that not only formalizing slums but also supporting self-help efforts by the residents of non-formalized slums would be effective for improving their housing conditions.},

abstract = {A sensitivity analysis displays the increase in uncertainty that attends an inference when a key assumption is relaxed. In matched observational studies of treatment effects, a key assumption in some analyses is that subjects matched for observed covariates are comparable, and this assumption is relaxed by positing a relevant covariate that was not observed and not controlled by matching. What properties would such an unobserved covariate need to have to materially alter the inference about treatment effects? For ease of calculation and reporting, it is convenient that the sensitivity analysis be of low dimension, perhaps indexed by a scalar sensitivity parameter, but for interpretation in specific contexts, a higher dimensional analysis may be of greater relevance. An amplification of a sensitivity analysis is defined as a map from each point in a low dimensional sensitivity analysis to a set of points, perhaps a 'curve,' in a higher dimensional sensitivity analysis such that the possible inferences are the same for all points in the set. Possessing an amplification, an investigator may calculate and report the low dimensional analysis, yet have available the interpretations of the higher dimensional analysis.},

abstract = {The purpose of this article is to formalize the generalization criterion method for model comparison. The method has the potential to provide powerful comparisons of complex and nonnested models that may also differ in terms of numbers of parameters. The generalization criterion differs from the better known cross-validation criterion in the following critical procedure. Although both employ a calibration stage to estimate parameters, cross-validation employs a replication sample from the same design for the validation stage, whereas generalization employs a new design for the critical stage. Two examples of the generalization criterion method are presented that demonstrate its usefulness for selecting a model based on sound scientific principles out of a set that also contains models lacking sound scientific principles that are either overly complex or oversimplified. The main advantage of the generalization criterion is its reliance on extrapolations to new conditions. After all, accurate a priori predictions to new conditions are the hallmark of a good scientific theory. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Applied researchers are increasingly interested in whether and how treatment effects vary in randomized evaluations, especially variation not explained by observed covariates. We propose a model-free approach for testing for the presence of such unexplained variation. To use this randomization-based approach, we must address the fact that the average treatment effect, generally the object of interest in randomized experiments, actually acts as a nuisance parameter in this setting. We explore potential solutions and advocate for a method that guarantees valid tests in finite samples despite this nuisance. We also show how this method readily extends to testing for heterogeneity beyond a given model, which can be useful for assessing the sufficiency of a given scientific theory. We finally apply our method to the National Head Start Impact Study, a large-scale randomized evaluation of a Federal preschool program, finding that there is indeed significant unexplained treatment effect variation.},

abstract = {In weighted moment condition models, we show a subtle link between identification and estimability that limits the practical usefulness of estimators based on these models. In particular, if it is necessary for (point) identification that the weights take arbitrarily large values, then the parameter of interest, though point identified, cannot be estimated at the regular (parametric) rate and is said to be irregularly identified. This rate depends on relative tail conditions and can be as slow in some examples as n -1/4. This nonstandard rate of convergence can lead to numerical instability and/or large standard errors. We examine two weighted model examples: (i) the binary response model under mean restriction introduced by Lewbel (1997) and further generalized to cover endogeneity and selection, where the estimator in this class of models is weighted by the density of a special regressor, and (ii) the treatment effect model under exogenous selection (Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983)), where the resulting estimator of the average treatment effect is one that is weighted by a variant of the propensity score. Without strong relative support conditions, these models, similar to well known “identified at infinity” models, lead to estimators that converge at slower than parametric rate, since essentially, to ensure point identification, one requires some variables to take values on sets with arbitrarily small probabilities, or thin sets. For the two models above, we derive some rates of convergence and propose that one conducts inference using rate adaptive procedures that are analogous to Andrews and Schafgans (1998) for the sample selection model.},

abstract = {To what degree can agricultural workers in developing countries manage transitory labour demand shocks by moving across sectors? Combining worker-level, firm-level and district-level data with high-resolution meteorological data I examine the effects of the weather on economic activity within local labour markets in India. I estimate that increases in temperature are associated with a reduction in agricultural production, but that prices do not respond consistent with a “law of one price”. Consequently, I find that workers are able to manage reductions in agricultural labour demand by moving into the manufacturing sector. These results indicate that the ability of other sectors to absorb workers is one of the main ways that workers are able to manage agricultural productivity shocks, highlighting the importance of market integration and diversification. Having established this I examine the effects of labour reallocation on economic outcomes in the formal manufacturing sector. I find that workers move into casual manufacturing activities, with a corresponding decrease in the average wage of casual workers, suggesting that workers face little impediment in the movement across sectors within casual tasks. In addition this reallocation results in an increase in manufacturing productivity, the average wage of permanent manufacturing workers, and an increase in the number of items that the firm produces – a restructuring of production. Consequently, the reallocation of labour across sectors could significantly attenuate the aggregate consequences of weather shocks in developing countries},

There appears to be a perception that such methods are theoretically justified, even though they can lead to evidently nonsensical results. We argue that controlling for global high-order polynomials in regression discontinuity analysis is a flawed approach with three major problems: it leads to noisy estimates, sensitivity to the degree of the polynomial, and poor coverage of confidence intervals. We recommend researchers instead use estimators based on local linear or quadratic polynomials or other smooth functions.},

Four years on, an experimental evaluation found grants raised work by 17 percent and earnings by 38 percent (Blattman, Fiala, Martinez 2014). After nine years, we find these gains have dissipated. Grantees' investment leveled off; controls eventually increased their incomes through business and casual labor; and so both groups converged in employment, earnings, and consumption levels. We see little effect on mortality, fertility, or family health and education. However, grants had lasting impacts on durable asset stocks and skilled work. (JEL H53, I32, I38, O15, O22)},

abstract = {This paper concerns the problem of allocating a binary treatment among a target population based on observed covariates. The goal is to (i) maximize the mean social welfare arising from an eventual outcome distribution, when a budget constraint limits what fraction of the population can be treated and (ii) to infer the dual value, i.e. the minimum resources needed to attain a specific level of mean welfare via efficient treatment assignment. We consider a treatment allocation procedure based on sample data from randomized treatment assignment and derive asymptotic frequentist confidence interval for the welfare generated from it. We propose choosing the conditioning covariates through cross-validation. The methodology is applied to the efficient provision of anti-malaria bed net subsidies, using data from a randomized experiment conducted in Western Kenya. We find that subsidy allocation based on wealth, presence of children and possession of bank account can lead to a rise in subsidy use by about 9% points compared to allocation based on wealth only, and by 17% points compared to a purely random allocation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper develops a dynamic empirical model that links these features of the business environment to firm ownership patterns, firm size distributions, productivity distributions, borrowing patterns, and cross-household savings behavior. Applied to panel data on Colombian apparel producers, the model yields econometric estimates of a credit market imperfection index, the sunk costs of creating a new business, and various other parameters. It also provides a basis for several counterfactual experiments. These show, inter alia, that an efficient credit market would improve the weighted-average efficiency of producers by about 5 percent, partly by allowing the most productive producers to expand and partly by reducing the incentives for inefficient firms to remain in the market. The gains from better intermediation accrue mainly during periods of macro volatility, and mainly to households with modest wealth but high entrepreneurial ability.},

@article{Alatas2013,
abstract = {Economic theory suggests that, when designing aid programs, ordeal mechanisms that impose differential costs for rich and poor can induce self-selection and hence improve targeting (“self-targeting”). We first re-examine this theory and show that ordeal mechanisms may actually have theoretically ambiguous effects on targeting: for example, time spent applying imposes a higher monetary cost on the rich, but may impose a higher utility cost on the poor. We then examine these issues empirically by conducting a 400-village field experiment within Indonesia's Conditional Cash Transfer program. Targeting in the program is usually conducted by automatically enrolling candidates who pass an asset test. We compare whether instituting an ordeal mechanism, where villagers come to a central application site to apply and take the asset test, improves targeting over the existing automatic enrollment system. Within self-targeting villages, we find that the poor are more likely to apply, even conditional on whether they would pass the asset test. On net, self-targeting villages have a much poorer group of beneficiaries than status quo villages. However, marginally increasing the ordeal does not necessarily improve targeting: while experimentally increasing the distance to the application site reduces the number of applicants, it screens out both rich and poor in roughly equal proportions. Estimating the model structurally, we show that only one would need to increase the ordeal dramatically (e.g. tripling wait times to 9 hours or more) to induce detectable additional selection. In short, ordeal mechanisms can induce self-selection, but marginally increasing the ordeal can impose additional costs on applicants without necessarily improving targeting.},

abstract = {This article considers the problem of assessing the distributional consequences of a treatment on some outcome variable of interest when treatment intake is (possibly) nonrandomized, but there is a binary instrument available for the researcher. Such a scenario is common in observational studies and in randomized experiments with imperfect compliance. One possible approach to this problem is to compare the counterfactual cumulative distribution functions of the outcome with and without the treatment. This article shows how to estimate these distributions using instrumental variable methods and a simple bootstrap procedure is proposed to test distributional hypotheses, such as equality of distributions, first-order and second-order stochastic dominance. These tests and estimators are applied to the study of the effects of veteran status on the distribution of civilian earnings. The results show a negative effect of military service during the Vietnam era that appears to be concentrated on the lower tail of the distribution of earnings. First-order stochastic dominance cannot be rejected by the data.},

@article{Dell2014,
abstract = {Drug trade-related violence has escalated dramatically in Mexico during the past five years, claiming 40,000 lives and raising concerns about the capacity of the Mexican state to monopolize violence. This study examines how drug traffickers economic objectives influence the direct and spillover effects of Mexican policy towards the drug trade. By exploiting variation from close mayoral elections and a network model of drug trafficking, the study develops three sets of results. First, regression discontinuity estimates show that drug trade-related violence in a municipality increases substantially after the close election of a mayor from the conservative National Action Party (PAN), which has spearheaded the war on drug trafficking. This violence consists primarily of individuals involved in the drug trade killing each other. The empirical evidence suggests that the violence reflects rival traffickers attempts to wrest control of territories after crackdowns initiated by PAN mayors have challenged the incumbent criminals. Second, the study accurately predicts diversion of drug traffic following close PAN victories. It does this by estimating a model of equilibrium routes for trafficking drugs across the Mexican road network to the U.S. When drug traffic is diverted to other municipalities, drug trade-related violence in these municipalities increases. Moreover, female labor force participation and informal sector wages fall, corroborating qualitative evidence that traffickers extort informal sector producers. Finally, the study uses the trafficking model and estimated spillover effects to examine the allocation of law enforcement resources. Overall, the results demonstrate how traffickers economic objectives and constraints imposed by the routes network affect the policy outcomes of the Mexican Drug War.},

Does this imply that targeting transfers to women promotes economic development? Not necessarily. We consider a noncooperative model of the household where a gender wage gap leads to endogenous household specialization. As a result, women indeed spend more on children and invest more in human capital. Yet, depending on the nature of the production function, targeting transfers to women may be beneficial or harmful to growth. Transfers to women are more likely to be beneficial when human capital, rather than physical capital or land, is the most important factor of production. We provide empirical evidence supportive of our mechanism: In Mexican PROGRESA data, transfers to women lead to an increase in spending on children, but a decline in the savings rate.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a methodology for defining urban markets based on economic activity detected by satellite imagery. We use nighttime lights data, whose use in economics is increasingly common, to define urban markets based on contiguous pixels that have a minimum threshold of light intensity. The coarseness of the nightlight data and the blooming effect of lights, however, create markets whose boundaries are too expansive and too smooth relative to the visual inspection of actual cities. We compare nightlight-based markets to those formed using high-resolution daytime satellite imagery, whose use in economics is less common, to detect the presence of builtup landcover. We identify an order of magnitude more markets with daytime imagery; these markets are realistically jagged in shape and reveal much more within and across-market variation in the density of economic activity. The size of landcover-based markets displays a sharp sensitivity to the proximity of paved roads that is not present in the case of nightlight-based markets. Our results suggest that daytime satellite imagery is a promising source of data for economists to study the spatial extent and distribution of economic activity.},

Given that innate talent for these professions is unlikely to differ between men and women or between blacks and whites, the alloca- tion of talent in 1960 suggests that a substantial pool of innately talented black men, blackwomen, and white women were not pursuing their comparative advantage. This paper estimates the contribution to U.S. economic growth from the changing occupational allocation of white women, black men, and black women between 1960 and 2008. We find that the contribution is significant: 17 to 20 percent of growth over this period might be explained simply by the improved allocation of talentwithin theUnited States.},

Against that background, we explore whether incorporating stochastic volatility improves DSGE forecasts (point, interval, and density). We examine real-time forecast accuracy for key macroeconomic variables including output growth, inflation, and the policy rate. We find that incorporating stochastic volatility in DSGE models of macroeconomic fundamentals markedly improves their density forecasts, just as incorporating stochastic volatility in models of financial asset returns improves their density forecasts.},

Unfortunately, the proposed correction is negatively biased (sometimes even resulting in negative estimated variances) and therefore leads to overestimation of the inferred significance.We present an unbiased correction procedure and apply it to the models reported by Feenstra and Hanson (1999) and Haskel and Slaughter (2002).},

abstract = {This paper examines the asymptotic behavior of the posterior distribution of a possibly nondifferentiable function g($\theta$), where $\theta$ is a finite-dimensional parameter of either a parametric or semiparametric model. The main assumption is that the distribution of a suitable estimator $\theta$̂n, its bootstrap approximation, and the Bayesian posterior for $\theta$ all agree asymptotically. It is shown that whenever g is locally Lipschitz, though not necessarily differentiable, the posterior distribution of g($\theta$) and the bootstrap distribution of g($\theta$̂n) coincide asymptotically. One implication is that Bayesians can interpret bootstrap inference for g($\theta$) as approximately valid posterior inference in a large sample. Another implication—built on known results about bootstrap inconsistency—is that credible intervals for a nondifferentiable parameter g($\theta$) cannot be presumed to be approximately valid confidence intervals (even when this relation holds true for $\theta$).},

@article{Evans2015,
abstract = {In the past two years alone, at least six systematic reviews or meta-analyses have examined the interventions that improve learning outcomes in low- and middle-income countries. However, these reviews have sometimes reached starkly different conclusions: reviews, in turn, recommend information technology, interventions that provide information about school quality, or even basic infrastructure (such as desks) to achieve the greatest improvements in student learning. This paper demonstrates that these divergent conclusions are largely driven by differences in the samples of research incorporated by each review. The top recommendations in a given review are often driven by the results of evaluations not included in other reviews. Of 227 studies with student learning results, the most inclusive review incorporates less than half of the total studies. Variance in classification also plays a role. Across the reviews, the three classes of programs that are recommended with some consistency (albeit under different names) are pedagogical interventions (including computer-assisted learning) that tailor teaching to student skills; repeated teacher training interventions, often linked to another pedagogical intervention; and improving accountability through contracts or performance incentives, at least in certain contexts. Future reviews will be most useful if they combine narrative review with meta-analysis, conduct more exhaustive searches, and maintain low aggregation of intervention categories.},

abstract = {We give a general construction of debiased/locally robust/orthogonal (LR) moment functions for GMM, where the derivative with respect to first step nonparametric estimation is zero and equivalently first step estimation has no effect on the influence function. This construction consists of adding an estimator of the influence function adjustment term for first step nonparametric estimation to identifying or original moment conditions. We also give numerical methods for estimating LR moment functions that do not require an explicit formula for the adjustment term. LR moment conditions have reduced bias and so are important when the first step is machine learning. We derive LR moment conditions for dynamic discrete choice based on first step machine learning estimators of conditional choice probabilities. We provide simple and general asymptotic theory for LR estimators based on sample splitting. This theory uses the additive decomposition of LR moment conditions into an identifying condition and a first step influence adjustment. Our conditions require only mean square consistency and a few (generally either one or two) readily interpretable rate conditions. LR moment functions have the advantage of being less sensitive to first step estimation. Some LR moment functions are also doubly robust meaning they hold if one first step is incorrect. We give novel classes of doubly robust moment functions and characterize double robustness. For doubly robust estimators our asymptotic theory only requires one rate condition.},

abstract = {This study uses the 1970 state abortion reforms to estimate the effect of teen and out-of-wedlock childbearing on the schooling and labor market outcomes of mothers observed in 1980 and 1990 Census microdata. Reduced-form estimates suggest that state abortion reforms had a negative impact on teen marriage, teen fertility, and teen out- of-wedlock childbearing. The teen marriage effects are largest and most precisely estimated for white women while the teen fertility and out-of-wedlock childbearing effects are largest and most precisely estimated for black women. The relatively modest fertility and marriage consequences of abortion reform for white women do not appear to have changed schooling or labor market outcomes. In contrast, black women who were exposed to abortion reforms experienced large reductions in teen fertility and teen out-of-wedlock fertility that appear to have led to increased schooling and employment rates. Instrumental variables estimates of the effects of teen and out-of- wedlock childbearing on the schooling and employment status of black women, using measures of exposure to abortion reform as instruments, are marginally significant and larger than the corresponding OLS estimates.},

Abstract Educational outcomes have many determinants, but one that most young people can readily control is choosing whether to work while in school. Sixty-nine studies have estimated the effect, but results vary from large negative to positive estimates. We show that the results are systematically driven by context, publication bias, and treatment of endogeneity. Studies ignoring endogeneity suffer from an upward bias, which is almost fully compensated by publication selection in favor of negative estimates. Net of the biases, the literature suggests a negative but economically inconsequential mean effect. The effect is more negative for high-intensity employment and educational outcomes measured as decisions to dropout, but it is positive in Germany. To derive these results we collect 861 previously reported estimates together with 32 variables reflecting estimation context, use recently developed nonlinear techniques to correct for publication bias, and employ Bayesian and frequentist model averaging to assign a pattern to the heterogeneity in the literature.},

Using data from the US and the UK, we show that taller children have higher average cognitive test scores, and that these test scores explain a large portion of the height premium in earnings. Children who have higher test scores also experience earlier adolescent growth spurts, so that height in adolescence serves as a marker of cognitive ability.},

abstract = {Social networks amplify inequalities by fundamental mechanisms of social tie formation such as homophily and triadic closure. These forces sharpen social segregation, which is reflected in fragmented social network structure. Geographical impediments such as distance and physical or administrative boundaries also reinforce social segregation. Yet, less is known about the joint relationships between social network structure, urban geography, and inequality. In this paper we analyze an online social network and find that the fragmentation of social networks is significantly higher in towns in which residential neighborhoods are divided by physical barriers such as rivers and railroads. Towns in which neighborhoods are relatively distant from the center of town and amenities are spatially concentrated are also more socially segregated. Using a two-stage model, we show that these urban geography features have significant relationships with income inequality via social network fragmentation. In other words, the geographic features of a place can compound economic inequalities via social networks.},

In industrialized economies, novel sources of data are enabling new approaches to demographic profiling, but in developing countries, fewer sources of big data exist. We show that an individuals past history of mobile phone use can be used to infer his or her socioeconomic status. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the predicted attributes of millions of individuals can, in turn, accurately reconstruct the distribution of wealth of an entire nation or to infer the asset distribution of microregions composed of just a few households. In resource-constrained environments where censuses and household surveys are rare, this approach creates an option for gathering localized and timely information at a fraction of the cost of traditional methods.},

abstract = {When theoretical work made it clear that being poor meant being cut off from many opportunities that were available to others, the task of empirical economics shifted to providing evidence for market inefficiencies and the potential of economic policies to alleviate them. A new paradigm, “poor but neoclassical”, helped define an empirical agenda and structure a vision of the world, even though it often remained implicit in empirical work. While the poor (and the rich) are all perfectly rational, the markets, left to themselves, may not produce an efficient outcome. In turn, many of the predictions of this body of work have been substantiated by the data. But there are also some fundamental facts for which this view of the world does not account. This essay explores this agenda using two classic examples, which have been very fertile ground for research in development economics: insurance and agricultural investment.},

abstract = {This article synthesizes case studies from Kenya, Zambia, and Ethiopia to assess how differences in the implementation of fertilizer marketing policies have affected the costs and risks borne by marketing actors, the investment response by private traders, and fertilizer consumption. Financial cost accounting techniques indicate that domestic marketing costs account for 50% or more of farm-gate prices. The sum of importer, wholesaler and retailer profit margins generally account for less than 10%. There are opportunities to reduce domestic marketing costs through the following: reducing port fees, coordinating the timing of fertilizer clearance from the port with up-country transport, reducing transport costs through port, rail, and road improvements, reducing high fuel taxes, and reducing the uncertainty associated with government input distribution programs that impose additional marketing costs on traders. Estimated reductions in the farm-gate price of fertilizer from implementing the full range of options identified in each country range from 11 to 18%. Price reductions of this magnitude, if passed along to farmers, would increase farmers' effective demand for fertilizer. Investments in selected publically provided goods, often considered outside the scope of fertilizer marketing policy per se, strongly affect the costs of fertilizer, farmers' willingness to pay for it, and hence the performance of markets. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this paper we develop a new censored quantile instrumental variable (CQIV) estimator and describe its properties and computation. The CQIV estimator combines Powell (1986) censored quantile regression (CQR) to deal with censoring, with a control variable approach to incorporate endogenous regressors. The CQIV estimator is obtained in two stages that are nonadditive in the unobservables. The first stage estimates a nonadditive model with infinite dimensional parameters for the control variable, such as a quantile or distribution regression model. The second stage estimates a nonadditive censored quantile regression model for the response variable of interest, including the estimated control variable to deal with endogeneity. For computation, we extend the algorithm for CQR developed by Chernozhukov and Hong (2002) to incorporate the estimation of the control variable. We give generic regularity conditions for asymptotic normality of the CQIV estimator and for the validity of resampling methods to approximate its asymptotic distribution. We verify these conditions for quantile and distribution regression estimation of the control variable. Our analysis covers two-stage (uncensored) quantile regression with nonadditive first stage as an important special case. We illustrate the computation and applicability of the CQIV estimator with a Monte-Carlo numerical example and an empirical application on estimation of Engel curves for alcohol.},

Unique panel data on primary school–age children in Egypt permit estimation of behavioral models of school leaving that incorporate output-based measures of school quality. With the student's own ability and achievement held constant, a student is much less likely to remain in school if attending a low-quality school rather than a high-quality school. This individually rational behavior suggests that common arguments about a trade-off between quality and access to schools may misstate the real issue and lead to public investment in too little quality.},

abstract = {Recent research yields widely divergent estimates of the cross-country relationship between foreign aid receipts and economic growth. We propose and test two reasons for this divergence, both of which relate to the timing of effects between aid and growth. First, these studies have insufficiently considered the lag with which aid might affect growth, particularly certain kinds of aid. Second, they have sought to reduce the bias from contemporaneous reverse causation with the use of instrumental variables that appear to be invalid, weak, or both. We reanalyze data from the three most influential published aid-growth studies, strictly conserving their regression specifications, adding sensible assumptions about timing and avoiding questionable instruments. With these changes, the research designs from all of these studies yield one finding: that increases in aid have been followed on average by modest increases in investment and growth. The most plausible explanation is that aid causes some degree of growth in recipient countries, though the magnitude of this relationship is modest, varies greatly across recipients, and diminishes at high levels of aid.},

@article{Meager2016a,
abstract = {Distributional treatment effects can be crucial for understanding the welfare impact of interventions in development economics, yet they are typically ignored in meta-analysis due to a lack of suitable aggregation methodologies. I develop and implement a new suite of Bayesian hierarchical models and associated pooling metrics to estimate the distributional treatment effects of expanding access to microcredit on household outcomes, and to assess the external validity of the results. This requires imposing a series of interdependent con-straints to ensure that the estimates imply proper outcome distributions in both treatment and control groups. The results show that each study exhibits large treatment effects on the variance of household outcomes, but these effects are not generalizable due to substantial heterogeneity across sites -this contrasts to the results on the average treatment effects, which are negligible but highly generalizable. Aggregating the quantile treatment effects resolves this apparent puzzle: microcredit generally does not affect the distribution of house-hold outcomes below the 75th quantile, and above this point the thickness of the tails and the potential for cross-site heterogeneity prevents reliable extrapolation to the general case. Policymakers should not base decisions about the funding of microcredit interventions on any purported upper tail effects, as we effectively cannot predict the effect on the upper quantiles in the next site. However, pooling metrics applied to the set of quantile effects detect substantial similarities across sites overall, due to strong pooling on the majority of the distribution which is generally unaffected by microcredit. Yaroslav Mukhin, and the audiences of the MIT Economic Development Lunch Seminar, MIT Econometrics Lunch Seminar and the MIT Summer Applied Micro Lunch Series for their suggestions, critiques, and advice. I also thank the authors of the 7 studies that I use in my analysis, and the journals in which they were published, for making their data and code public. All remaining mistakes are my own.

The program resulted in modest increases in toilet construction, decreased community tolerance of open defecation and reduced roundworm infestations in children. However, there was no impact on anemia, height or weight. We find important heterogeneity along three dimensions: (1) poverty—poorer households are limited in their ability to improve sanitation; (2) implementer identity—scale up involves local governments taking over implementation from World Bank contractors yet no sanitation and health benefits accrue in villages with local government implementation; and (3) initial levels of social capital—villages with high initial social capital built toilets whereas the community-led approach was counterproductive in low social capital villages with fewer toilets being built.},

@article{Tybout2000,
abstract = {Competition among manufacturers in developing countries is remarkably vigorous. Nonetheless, markets are imperfect, so the general trend toward trade liberalization has yielded benefits beyond the traditional gains from specialization. Manufacturing firms in developing countries have traditionally been relatively protected. They have also been subject to heavy regulation, much of it biased in favor of large enterprises. Accordingly, it is often argued that manufacturers in these countries perform poorly in several respects: Markets tolerate inefficient firms, so cross-firm productivity dispersion is high. Small groups of entrenched oligopolists exploit monopoly power in product markets. Many small firms are unable or unwilling to grow, so important economies of scale go unexploited. Tybout assesses each of these conjectures, drawing on plant- and firm-level studies of manufacturers in developing countries. He finds systematic support for none of them. Turnover is substantial, exploited scale economies are modest, and convincing demonstrations of monopoly rents are generally lacking. Overprotection and overregulation are probably less a problem in developing countries than are uncertainty about policies and demand, poor rule of law, and corruption. Tybout does find some evidence that protection increases firms' price-cost margins and reduces average efficiency levels at the margin. And although the econometric evidence on technology diffusion in developing countries is limited, it does suggest that protecting "learning" industries is unlikely to foster productivity growth. All of which suggests that the general trend toward trade liberalization has yielded greater benefits than the traditional gains from trade. This paper-a product of Trade, Development Research Group-is part of a larger effort in the group to link firm-level performance with commerical policy.

abstract = {We extend the basic Schumpeterian endogenous growth model by allowing incumbents to undertake innovations to improve their products, while entrants engage in more radical innovations to replace incumbents. Our model provides a tractable framework for the analysis of growth driven by both entry of new firms and productivity improvements by continuing firms. Unlike in the basic Schumpeterian models, subsidies to potential entrants might decrease economic growth because they discourage productivity improvements by incumbents in response to reduced entry, which may outweigh the positive effect of greater creative destruction. As the model features entry of new firms and expansion and exit of existing firms, it also generates a non-degenerate equilibrium firm size distribution. We show that, when there is also costly imitation preventing any sector from falling too far below the average, the stationary firm size distribution is Pareto with an exponent approximately equal to one (the so-called Zipf distribution).},

@article{Mogstad2016a,
abstract = {We propose a method for using instrumental variables (IV) to draw inference about causal e↵ects for individuals other than those a↵ected by the instrument at hand. The question of policy relevance and external validity turns on our ability to do this reli-ably. Our method exploits the insight that both the IV estimand and many treatment parameters can be expressed as weighted averages of the same underlying marginal treatment e↵ects. Since the weights are known or identified, knowledge of the IV es-timand generally places some restrictions on the unknown marginal treatment e↵ects, and hence on the logically permissible values of the treatment parameters of interest. We show how to extract the information about the average e↵ect of interest from the IV estimand, and more generally, from a class of IV-like estimands which includes the TSLS and OLS estimands, among many others. Our method has several applications. First, it can be used to construct nonparametric bounds on the average causal e↵ects of an actual or hypothetical policy change. Second, our method allows the researcher to flexibly incorporate shape restrictions and parametric assumptions, thereby enabling extrapolation of the average e↵ects for compliers to the average e↵ects for di↵erent or larger populations. Third, our method provides specification tests. In addition to test-ing the null of correctly specified model, we can use our method to test null hypotheses of no selection bias, no selection on gains and instrument validity. Importantly, speci-fication tests using our method do not require the treatment e↵ect to be constant over individuals with the same observables. To illustrate the applicability of our method, we use Norwegian administrative data to draw inference about the causal e↵ects of family size on children's outcomes.},

abstract = {This study provides an overview of the current market situation in the fertilizer industry. In particular, it examines global trends in production, consumption, trade, and prices, with special emphasis given to the level of concentration of the industry at both the global and the country level. It then analyzes the market situation in key developing regions, including sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and South Asia. A regression analysis is conducted at the end of the study to formally examine the relationship between fertilizer (urea) prices and market concentration. The results of the study indicate that the fertilizer industry is a global market with high levels of concentration and increasing trade. The top five countries control more than 50 percent of the world's production capacity for all major fertilizer products. There is also a high level of concentration at the country level among the major producing countries, except for China. The high and increasing levels of trade in the industry are evident from the higher dependence of several regions on imported fertilizer. International fertilizer prices have also shown an upward trend in recent years. All three regions analyzed show high levels of concentration in production, as well as an increase in their imports, regardless of their different production and consumption levels. Thus, while South Asia is both a major fertilizer producer and consumer, sub-Saharan Africa is by far the smallest producer and consumer in the world. In addition, although Latin America is an important consumer, it is a small-sized producer. Finally, the regression analysis provides some evidence that urea prices tend to be higher in less competitive markets. It appears that despite the high levels of concentration in the industry, prices are even higher in further concentrated markets due to the apparent greater market power enjoyed by a couple of firms.},

This allows for a new approach to estimating the aggregate elasticity using microeconomic data and allows us to examine how the aggregate elasticity varies over time or across coun- tries. We then use plant level data from the Census of Manufactures to construct an aggregate elasticity of substitution for the manufacturing sector, and estimate an aggregate elasticity of approximately 0.72 in 1987. We find that the aggregate elasticity has risen over time in the US and is higher in less developed countries. These differences are quantitatively important; our estimates imply that a change in the interest rate has a 50 percent larger impact on India than the US. Finally, we measure the bias of aggregate technical change using our estimates of the aggregate elasticity, and find that the bias of technical change has increased in recent years.},

abstract = {We study strategic behaviour in heterogeneous network formation, where agents are grouped into types and can choose to create or sever links whilst maximising their own private interest. We show the conditions under which social networks exhibit segregated behaviour by groups, as a function of the individual benefits and the costs of linking. By introducing the idea of an individual having a degree of 'tolerance' for others not of their own type, we further show that this enriched framework is able to generate sophisticated intra-group segregation, where a group can shun one of its own members due to the connections that member has. Moreover, we find through simulations that group segregation is an endemic feature and that, as the cost of linking increases, networks converging to a stable state exhibit common characteristics with growing certainty.},

abstract = {The body of scientific literature on slum mapping employing remote sensing methods has increased since the availability of more very-high-resolution (VHR) sensors. This improves the ability to produce information for pro-poor policy development and to build methods capable of supporting systematic global slum monitoring required for international policy development such as the Sustainable Development Goals. This review provides an overview of slum mapping-related remote sensing publications over the period of 2000–2015 regarding four dimensions: contextual factors, physical slum characteristics, data and requirements, and slum extraction methods. The review has shown the following results. First, our contextual knowledge on the diversity of slums across the globe is limited, and slum dynamics are not well captured. Second, a more systematic exploration of physical slum characteristics is required for the development of robust image-based proxies. Third, although the latest commercial sensor technologies provide image data of less than 0.5 m spatial resolution, thereby improving object recognition in slums, the complex and diverse morphology of slums makes extraction through standard methods difficult. Fourth, successful approaches show diversity in terms of extracted information levels (area or object based), implemented indicator sets (single or large sets) and methods employed (e.g., object-based image analysis (OBIA) or machine learning). In the context of a global slum inventory, texture-based methods show good robustness across cities and imagery. Machine-learning algorithms have the highest reported accuracies and allow working with large indicator sets in a computationally efficient manner, while the upscaling of pixel-level information requires further research. For local slum mapping, OBIA approaches show good capabilities of extracting both area- and object-based information. Ultimately, establishing a more systematic relationship between higher-level image elements and slum characteristics is essential to train algorithms able to analyze variations in slum morphologies to facilitate global slum monitoring.},

@article{Chernozhukov2016,
abstract = {Most modern supervised statistical/machine learning (ML) methods are explicitly designed to solve prediction problems very well. Achieving this goal does not imply that these methods automatically deliver good estimators of causal parameters. Examples of such parameters include individual regression coefficients, average treatment effects, average lifts, and demand or supply elasticities. In fact, estimates of such causal parameters obtained via naively plugging ML estimators into estimating equations for such parameters can behave very poorly due to the regularization bias. Fortunately, this regularization bias can be removed by solving auxiliary prediction problems via ML tools. Specifically, we can form an orthogonal score for the target low-dimensional parameter by combining auxiliary and main ML predictions. The score is then used to build a de-biased estimator of the target parameter which typically will converge at the fastest possible 1/root(n) rate and be approximately unbiased and normal, and from which valid confidence intervals for these parameters of interest may be constructed. The resulting method thus could be called a "double ML" method because it relies on estimating primary and auxiliary predictive models. In order to avoid overfitting, our construction also makes use of the K-fold sample splitting, which we call cross-fitting. This allows us to use a very broad set of ML predictive methods in solving the auxiliary and main prediction problems, such as random forest, lasso, ridge, deep neural nets, boosted trees, as well as various hybrids and aggregators of these methods.},

@article{Foster2007,
abstract = {There is considerable evidence that producer-level churning contributes substantially to aggregate (industry) productivity growth, as more productive businesses displace less productive ones. However, this research has been limited by the fact that producer-level prices are typically unobserved; thus within-industry price differences are embodied in productivity measures. If prices reflect idiosyncratic demand or market power shifts, high “productivity” businesses may not be particularly efficient, and the literature's findings might be better interpreted as evidence of entering businesses displacing less profitable, but not necessarily less productive, exiting businesses. In this paper, we investigate the nature of selection and productivity growth using data from industries where we observe producer-level quantities and prices separately. We show there are important differences between revenue and physical productivity. A key dissimilarity is that physical productivity is inversely correlated with plant-level prices while revenue productivity is positively correlated with prices. This implies that previous work linking (revenue-based) productivity to survival has confounded the separate and opposing effects of technical efficiency and demand on survival, understating the true impacts of both. We further show that young producers charge lower prices than incumbents, and as such the literature understates the productivity advantage of new producers and the contribution of entry to aggregate productivity growth.},

abstract = {This paper develops methods of Bayesian inference in a sample selection model. The main feature of this model is that the outcome variable is only partially observed. We first present a Gibbs sampling algorithm for a model in which the selection and outcome errors are normally distributed. The algorithm is then extended to analyze models that are characterized by nonnormality. Specifically, we use a Dirichlet process prior and model the distribution of the unobservables as a mixture of normal distributions with a random number of components. The posterior distribution in this model can simultaneously detect the presence of selection effects and departures from normality. Our methods are illustrated using some simulated data and an abstract from the RAND health insurance experiment. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The classic example of a popular graph problem is called the “Kevin Bacon problem” in the literature. Given actor Kevin Bacon, a graph database links him to anyone else in the movie industry either by a direct link (had some role in a movie with Kevin Bacon) or by a chain of links (had some role in a movie with someone who had some role in a movie with Kevin Bacon). However, other graph problems look for the shortest paths among a set of paths in a transportation network, the smallest set of nodes that cover a graph, and so forth. There is no ANSI/ISO standard language for graphs, but the most popular ones are Gremlin, Neo4j, and SPARQL. They tend to model their syntax after SQL and/or mathematics.},

Evidence suggests that credit constraints have recently become important for schooling and other aspects of households' behavior. We highlight the importance of early childhood investments, as their response largely determines the impact of credit constraints on the overall lifetime acquisition of human capital. We also review the intergenerational literature and examine the macroeconomic impacts of credit constraints on social mobility and the income distribution. A common limitation across all areas of the human capital literature is the imposition of ad hoc constraints on credit. We propose a more careful treatment of the structure of government student loan programs and the incentive problems underlying private credit. We show that endogenizing constraints on credit for human capital helps explain observed borrowing, schooling, and default patterns and offers new insights about the design of government policy.},

This paper examines the implications of corruptibility and the potential abuse of authority for the effects and optimal design of (potentially non-linear) tax collection schemes. Amongst the findings are that: the distributional effects of evasion and corruption are unambiguously regressive under the kinds of schemes usual in practice; and collecting progressive taxes without inducing evasion or corruption may require that inspectors be paid commission on high income reports (but not on low), with the cost of this potentially creating what seems to be a previously-unnoticed trade-off between equity and efficiency.},

In this model, demand slopes and hence preferences are not identifiable without further restrictions because of the absence of independent variation of endogenous composition and exogenous location characteristics. Several solutions of this problem are presented and applied to data on neighborhoods in US cities. These solutions use exclusion restrictions, based on either subgroup demand shifters, the spatial structure of externalities, or the dynamics of prices and composition in response to an amenity shock. The empirical results consistently suggest the presence of strong social externalities, that is a dependence of location choices on neighborhood composition.},

We compare the robustness of five widely used techniques, two non-parametric and three parametric: in order, (a) index numbers, (b) data envelopment analysis (DEA), (c) stochastic frontiers, (d) instrumental variables (GMM) and (e) semiparametric estimation. Using simulated samples of firms, we analyze the sensitivity of alternative methods to the way randomness is introduced in the data generating process. Three experiments are considered, introducing randomness via factor price heterogeneity, measurement error and differences in production technology respectively. When measurement error is small, index numbers are excellent for estimating productivity growth and are among the best for estimating productivity levels. DEA excels when technology is heterogeneous and returns to scale are not constant. When measurement or optimization errors are nonnegligible, parametric approaches are preferred. Ranked by the persistence of the productivity differentials between firms (in decreasing order), one should prefer the stochastic frontiers, GMM, or semiparametric estimation methods. The practical relevance of each experiment for applied researchers is discussed explicitly.},

We analyze the evolution of Nairobi using a unique high-spatial resolution data set. The analysis suggests insufficient building volume through most of the city and large slum areas with low housing volumes near the center, where corrupted institutions deter conversion to formal sector usage.},

Instead, the researcher must only impose restrictions on possible violations of the parallel trends assumption, and our methodology then guarantees uniformly valid ("honest") inference when the imposed restrictions are satisfied. We first show that fixed length confidence intervals have near-optimal expected length for a practically-relevant class of restrictions. We next introduce a novel inference procedure that accommodates a wider range of restrictions on the possible violations of parallel trends, and is based on the observation that inference in our setting is equivalent to testing a system of moment inequalities with a large number of linear nuisance parameters. The resulting confidence sets are consistent, and have optimal local asymptotic power for many parameter configurations. We recommend researchers conduct sensitivity analyses to show what conclusions can be drawn under various restrictions on the set of possible violations of parallel trends.},

We find different responses to fluctuations and long-run growth, both heterogeneous over the life cycle. Fertility was procyclical but declined and delayed with long-run growth; fluctuations late (but not early) in the reproductive period affected lifetime fertility. The results are consistent with models of the escape from the Malthusian trap, extended with a life cycle and liquidity constraints. (JEL D15, I12, I15, J13, J16, O15, O47)},

abstract = {Prediction of macroeconomic aggregates is one of the primary functions of macroeconometric models, including dynamic factor models, dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models, and vector autoregressions. This study establishes methods that improve the predictions of thesemodels, using a representative model from each class and a canonical 7-variable postwar US data set. It focuses on pre- diction over the period 1966 through 2011. It measures the quality of prediction by the probability densities assigned to the actual values of these variables, one quarter ahead, by the predictive distributions of the models in real time. Two steps lead to substantial improvement. The {\ldots}rst is to use full Bayesian predictive distributions rather than substitute a “plug-in”posterior mode for parameters. Across models and quarters, this leads to a mean improvement in probability of 50.4%. The second is to use an equally-weighted pool of predictive densities from the three models, which leads to a mean improvement in probability of 41.9% over the full Bayesian predictive distributions of the individual models. This im- provement is much better than that a¤orded by Bayesian model averaging. The study uses several analytical tools, including pooling, analysis of predictive vari- ance, and probability integral transform tests, to understand and interpret the improvements.},

We compare these two data sources for predicting GDP, especially at the second subnational level, for Indonesia, China and South Africa. The DMSP data are a poor proxy for GDP outside of cities. The gap in predictive performance between DMSP data and VIIRS data is especially apparent at lower levels of the spatial hierarchy, such as for counties, and for lower density areas. The city lights-GDP relationship is twice as noisy with DMSP data than with VIIRS data. Spatial inequality is considerably understated with DMSP data, especially for the urban sector and in higher density areas. A Pareto adjustment to correct for top-coding in DMSP data has a modest effect but still understates spatial inequality and misses key features of economic activity in big cities.},
